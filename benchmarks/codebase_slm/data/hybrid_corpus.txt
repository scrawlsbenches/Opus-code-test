Q: How can we adjust our codebase so that it doesn't cause excessive commits or this just how it is? A: Good question. The current setup creates a commit cascade because each commit triggers the post-commit hook, which saves ML data, which then needs to be committed. Let me look at the hook configuration and propose solutions:

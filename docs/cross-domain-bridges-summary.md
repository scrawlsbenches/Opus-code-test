# Cross-Domain Bridge Documents Summary

**Generated:** 2025-12-19
**Based on:** Cognitive Pipeline Analysis findings

## Overview

Three bridge documents were created to address knowledge gaps identified by the cognitive pipeline analysis. These documents strengthen conceptual connections across domains.

## Document 1: Temporal Reasoning in Predictive Systems

**File:** `samples/cross_domain/temporal_reasoning_predictive_systems.md`

**Purpose:** Bridge cognitive science ↔ AI market prediction (distance: 2)

**Key Concepts:**
- Hierarchical temporal processing (milliseconds → lifetime)
- Multi-scale market patterns (intraday → long-term regimes)
- World models as temporal dynamics learners

**Bridging Principles:**
| Principle | Cognitive | AI |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Hierarchical Processing | Nested oscillations | Multi-temporal architectures |
| Uncertainty Quantification | Metacognitive monitoring | Probabilistic forecasts |
| Adaptive Time Horizons | Attention depth adjustment | Architecture/window selection |
| Temporal Abstraction | Cognitive schemas | Temporal embeddings |

## Document 2: Cognitive Load in Workflow Design

**File:** `samples/cross_domain/workflow_cognitive_load_bridge.md`

**Purpose:** Bridge workflow practices ↔ cognitive science (distance: 3)

**Key Concepts:**
- Three load types: intrinsic, extraneous, germane
- Working memory capacity (~4 chunks)
- Task switching costs

**Workflow ↔ Cognitive Load Mappings:**
| Workflow Practice | Cognitive Mechanism |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Task decomposition | Intrinsic load management |
| Documentation templates | Extraneous load reduction |
| Batch processing | Context switch minimization |
| Immediate feedback | Germane load maximization |

**Optimization Framework:**
1. Minimize extraneous load (standardize, template, simplify)
2. Manage intrinsic load (sequence, scaffold, chunk)
3. Maximize germane load (focus, practice, reflect)

## Document 3: Embodied Simulation Synthesis

**File:** `samples/cross_domain/embodied_simulation_synthesis.md`

**Purpose:** Merge embodied cognition + representation clusters via "simulation"

**Key Insight:** Representation and embodiment are not opposites—mental representations ARE embodied simulations.

**Simulation Types:**
| Type | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Motor | Imagined actions activate premotor cortex |
| Perceptual | Imagery engages sensory cortices |
| Social | Mirror neurons simulate other minds |
| Temporal | Future/past share neural mechanisms |

**Representation Formats:**
- Explicit states (conscious, articulable)
- Implicit dynamics (procedural know-how)
- Probabilistic distributions (uncertainty through variation)
- Hierarchical structures (plans → actions)

**AI Implications:**
- Learned simulators as internal engines
- Grounded symbols via simulated experience
- Active inference for prediction-error reduction
- Mental practice for sample-efficient learning

## Integration Summary

| Document | Gap Addressed | Key Bridge Concept |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Temporal Reasoning | AI ↔ Cognitive | Time-scale hierarchy |
| Cognitive Load | Workflow ↔ Cognitive | Working memory limits |
| Embodied Simulation | Embodied ↔ Representational | Simulation as substrate |

**Common Thread:** All three documents leverage **prediction** as the unifying mechanism—temporal prediction, cognitive prediction of load/effort, and simulation-based prediction of outcomes.

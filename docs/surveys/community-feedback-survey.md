# Developer Feedback Survey: Cortical Text Processor

**Time to complete:** ~5 minutes
**Format:** Open-ended questions (your words, not checkboxes)

---

We're building a zero-dependency Python library for hierarchical text analysis. We want to understand what you're working on and whether this could be useful to you—or what would need to change for it to be.

---

## Questions

### 1. What are you building?

Tell us briefly about your project. What text or search problems are you trying to solve?

```
[Your answer]
```

---

### 2. When you looked at our README or docs, what was unclear?

What made you pause, re-read, or think "I don't get why I'd use this"? Be specific—confusing sections, missing context, unexplained concepts.

```
[Your answer]
```

---

### 3. What's the most annoying part of your current text/search workflow?

What friction do you hit repeatedly? What do you wish "just worked"?

```
[Your answer]
```

### 4. If this library could do one thing really well for your project, what would it be?

Don't worry about whether it's technically feasible. What capability would actually change how you work?

```
[Your answer]
```

### 5. What would you need to see before you'd try this in a real project?

Examples? Benchmarks? A specific integration? A feature we don't have? Tell us what's blocking you.

```
[Your answer]

### 6. Anything else?

Reactions, suggestions, questions, complaints—whatever's on your mind.

```

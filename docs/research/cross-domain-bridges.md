# Cross-Domain Semantic Bridges

**Task #131**: Investigation of how concepts bridge across domains in the corpus.

This analysis identifies terms, relations, and concept clusters that connect different topic domains.

## 1. Bridging Terms

Terms that appear in multiple domains, ranked by number of domains spanned.

### Spanning 6 Domains

| Term | Domains | PageRank | Documents |
|------|---------|----------|-----------|
| assert | algorithms, customer_service, database, knowledge_graphs, other, software_engineering | 0.0191 | 48 |
| processor | algorithms, customer_service, database, knowledge_graphs, other, software_engineering | 0.0154 | 61 |
| test | algorithms, customer_service, database, knowledge_graphs, other, software_engineering | 0.0129 | 71 |
| tests | algorithms, customer_service, database, knowledge_graphs, other, software_engineering | 0.0066 | 62 |
| query | algorithms, customer_service, database, knowledge_graphs, other, software_engineering | 0.0063 | 62 |
| documents | algorithms, customer_service, database, knowledge_graphs, other, software_engineering | 0.0058 | 73 |
| term | algorithms, customer_service, database, knowledge_graphs, other, software_engineering | 0.0054 | 60 |
| doc_id | algorithms, customer_service, database, knowledge_graphs, other, software_engineering | 0.0050 | 54 |
| terms | algorithms, customer_service, database, knowledge_graphs, other, software_engineering | 0.0050 | 65 |
| results | algorithms, customer_service, database, knowledge_graphs, other, software_engineering | 0.0047 | 66 |

**Key Insights:**

- Most connected term: **assert** spanning 6 domains
- Bridging terms indicate common concepts across specializations
- High PageRank bridging terms are central to corpus vocabulary

## 2. Cross-Domain Semantic Relations

Semantic relations connecting terms from different domains.

### Top Cross-Domain Connections

| Term 1 (Domains) | Relation | Term 2 (Domains) | Confidence |
|------------------|----------|------------------|------------|
| defaultdict (algorithms, database, knowledge_graphs, other) | CoOccurs | float (software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| hookcallback (other) | CoOccurs | self (database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| hook_type (other) | CoOccurs | self (database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| _task_handlers (other) | CoOccurs | self (database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| _context_items (other) | CoOccurs | self (database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| _file_access_log (other) | CoOccurs | self (database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| _manager (other) | CoOccurs | self (database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| _results (other) | CoOccurs | self (database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| _dir (other) | CoOccurs | self (database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| _processor (other) | CoOccurs | self (database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| _invalidate_lateral_cache (other) | CoOccurs | self (database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| query_module (other) | CoOccurs | return (customer_service, database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| query_module (other) | CoOccurs | self (database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| oldest_key (other) | CoOccurs | self (database, software_engineering) | 3.000 |
| print (software_engineering) | CoOccurs | stages (database, other) | 3.000 |

**Key Insights:**

- Cross-domain relations reveal unexpected connections between fields
- These links could enable analogical reasoning across domains
- High-confidence relations suggest strong semantic bridges

## 3. Spanning Concept Clusters

Concept clusters whose member terms come from multiple domains.

*No spanning concept clusters found.*

This suggests concepts are domain-specific, which may be expected for specialized corpora.

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis:

1. **Use bridging terms for cross-domain search**
   - Terms spanning multiple domains can improve recall across topics
   - Focus on high-PageRank bridging terms like 'assert'

2. **Leverage cross-domain relations for analogies**
   - Semantic relations connecting domains enable analogical reasoning
   - Could enhance query expansion across topic boundaries

4. **Expand corpus for richer cross-domain connections**
   - More documents increase chances of discovering bridges
   - Diverse topics enhance cross-domain semantic richness

# Cortical Development Manifesto

> Principles for human-AI collaborative development

## We Value

**Working systems over comprehensive documentation**
Ship code that works. Document what matters. Let git history tell the story.

**Learning from outcomes over planning in isolation**
The Hubris system embodies this: predictions earn credibility through results, not claims.

**Parallel progress over sequential perfection**
Multiple threads, multiple sprints, multiple experts. Isolation enables velocity.

**Measured confidence over blind certainty**
Calibration tracking exists for a reason. Know when you don't know.

## Principles

### 1. Profile Before Optimizing
The obvious culprit is often innocent. Measure, then act.

### 2. Test Before Committing
Coverage isn't bureaucracy—it's confidence. Don't regress what you touch.

### 3. Isolate to Parallelize
Sprints with non-overlapping files can run concurrently without conflict.

### 4. Credit Earned, Not Assumed
Experts start equal. Performance determines influence. Hubris is earned.

### 5. Cold Start Is Not Failure
New systems lack data. Acknowledge it clearly. Provide fallbacks gracefully.

### 6. Document Decisions, Not Just Code
Why matters more than what. ADRs capture context that code cannot.

### 7. Dog-Food Everything
Use the system to build the system. Real usage reveals what tests miss.

### 8. Honest Assessment Over Pride
Say "I don't know" when uncertain. Correct course based on evidence.

## For Parallel Threads

```
Each thread picks a sprint.
Each sprint owns its files.
Shared files get careful edits.
Merge conflicts become rare.
```

**Sprint Status Protocol:**
- 🟢 Available → Pick it up
- 🟡 In Progress → Someone's on it
- ✅ Complete → Move on
- 🔴 Blocked → Fix the blocker first

---

## The Hubris Paradox

The system is named for excessive confidence, yet teaches humility:

- Overconfident predictions lose credits
- Underconfident predictions miss opportunities
- Well-calibrated predictions earn trust

*True expertise is knowing the boundaries of your knowledge.*

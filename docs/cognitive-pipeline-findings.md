## Query Expansion Results

For "world models and prediction":

| Expanded Term | Weight | Relevance |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| predictions | 1.93 | Direct semantic match |
| cognitive | 1.19 | Domain context |
| uncertainty | 1.19 | Key prediction attribute |

## Actionable Insights

1. **Prediction-Cognition Bridge**: The strongest pathway connects predictive models to cognitive science through "learning" → "uncertainty" → "temporal reasoning"

2. **Social Influence Gateway**: Market prediction connects to social dynamics via "behavior" and "social proof" patterns

3. **World Model Foundation**: World models serve as the architectural substrate connecting:
   - Cognitive representations (mental models)
   - AI systems (learned world models)
   - Market predictions (regime detection)

4. **Temporal Reasoning Core**: Time-based concepts are universally important - strengthen temporal reasoning content across all domains

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Create bridge document**: "Temporal Reasoning in Predictive Systems" connecting cognitive science and AI market prediction

2. **Strengthen weak link**: Add content connecting workflow practices to cognitive load theory

3. **Explore cluster merge**: Embodied cognition + representation clusters share "simulation" - potential synthesis opportunity

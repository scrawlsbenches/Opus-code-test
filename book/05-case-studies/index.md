# Case Studies

*Real problem-solving sessions from the development of the Cortical Text Processor*

No case studies available yet. Case studies are generated from ML session data when sessions demonstrate significant problem-solving narratives.

**What makes a good case study?**

- At least 5 exchanges (substantial investigation)
- Multiple tools used (shows exploration)
- Resulted in commits (concrete outcome)
- Clear problem statement (queries starting with 'fix', 'why', 'how do', etc.)

*These case studies are automatically generated from ML session data collected during development. They demonstrate real problem-solving workflows and serve as both documentation and learning material.*

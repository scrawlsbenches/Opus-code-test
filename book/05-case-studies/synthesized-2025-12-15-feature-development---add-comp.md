# Case Study: Feature Development - Add comprehensive delegation command template

*Synthesized from commit history: 2025-12-15*

## The Problem

A new feature was required: Add reusable pre-merge sanity check command. This would require careful implementation and testing.

## The Journey

The development progressed through several stages:

1. **Add reusable pre-merge sanity check command** - Modified 1 files (+79/-0 lines)
2. **Add comprehensive delegation command template** - Modified 1 files (+165/-0 lines)


## The Solution

Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into claude/multi-index-design-DvifZ

The solution involved changes to 28 files, adding 6031 lines and removing 63 lines.


## The Lesson

**Feature development is iterative.** Breaking work into smaller commits makes it easier to review, test, and debug.

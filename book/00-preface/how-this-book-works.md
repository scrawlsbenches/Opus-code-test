# How This Book Works

> *"The best documentation is the kind that writes itself."*

## Overview

The Cortical Chronicles is a **self-documenting book**. It uses the Cortical Text Processor—the very system it documents—to generate its own content. This creates a fascinating recursive property: the book understands itself through the same algorithms it explains.

## The Generation Process

## Chapter Types

### 01-foundations/
Algorithm deep-dives extracted from `docs/VISION.md`. Each algorithm (PageRank, BM25, Louvain, etc.) gets its own chapter with:
- Purpose and intuition
- Mathematical formulation
- Implementation details
- Why it matters for code search

### 02-architecture/
Module documentation generated from `.ai_meta` files. Includes:
- Module purpose and dependencies
- Key functions and classes
- Mermaid dependency graphs

### 03-decisions/
Architecture Decision Records from `samples/decisions/`. Documents the "why" behind design choices.

### 04-evolution/
A narrative of project history generated from git commits. Transforms raw commit logs into a readable story of how the project evolved.

### 05-future/
Roadmap and vision from task files and `VISION.md`. Shows where the project is heading.

## The Self-Reference Loop

Here's what makes this book special:

1. **The processor indexes its own code** → Creates a semantic graph
2. **The generators query that graph** → Find relevant content
3. **The book explains those algorithms** → Reader understands the system
4. **The system processes those explanations** → Understands itself better

This isn't just cute—it's a powerful test of the system's capabilities. If the Cortical Text Processor can understand and explain itself, it can understand any codebase.

## Regenerating the Book

The book regenerates automatically on every push to `main`:

```bash
# Manual regeneration
python scripts/generate_book.py

# Generate specific chapter
python scripts/generate_book.py --chapter foundations

# Preview without writing
python scripts/generate_book.py --dry-run
```

## Searching the Book

The book includes a semantic search interface. Open `index.html` to:
- Search by keyword or concept
- Browse by chapter
- Follow cross-references

The search uses the same algorithms described in the book—query expansion, BM25 scoring, PageRank boosting.

## Source Files

This chapter was written manually as the seed for the book. Future chapters are auto-generated from:
- `scripts/generate_book.py` - The orchestrator
- `docs/VISION.md:185-430` - Algorithm documentation source

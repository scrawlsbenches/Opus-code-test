# Query Expansion — Semantic Bridging

**Purpose:** Transform literal query terms into semantically enriched term sets.

**Implementation:** `cortical/query/expansion.py`

**Three Expansion Methods:**

1. **Lateral Connection Expansion:**
   - Follow co-occurrence edges from query terms
   - Score: `edge_weight × neighbor_score × 0.6`
   - Takes top 5 neighbors per query term

2. **Concept Cluster Membership:**
   - Find concepts containing query terms
   - Add other cluster members as expansions
   - Score: `concept.pagerank × member.pagerank × 0.4`

3. **Code Concept Synonyms:**
   - Programming-specific synonym groups (get/fetch/load, create/make/build)
   - Limited to 3 synonyms per term to prevent drift

**Multi-Hop Inference:**
```
Query: "neural"
  Hop 0: neural (1.0)
  Hop 1: networks (0.4), learning (0.35)
  Hop 2: deep (0.098) — via learning with decay
```

Chain validity is scored by relation type pairs:
- `(IsA, IsA)`: 1.0 — fully transitive (dog→animal→living_thing)
- `(RelatedTo, RelatedTo)`: 0.6 — weaker transitivity
- `(Antonym, Antonym)`: 0.3 — double negation, avoid

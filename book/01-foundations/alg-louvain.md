# Louvain Community Detection — Concept Discovery

**Purpose:** Discover semantic clusters (concepts) from the term co-occurrence graph.

**Implementation:** `cortical/analysis/clustering.py`

**Two-Phase Algorithm:**

**Phase 1 — Local Optimization:**
```
for each node:
    find neighboring communities
    calculate modularity gain for moving to each
    move to best community if gain > 0
repeat until no nodes move
```

**Phase 2 — Network Aggregation:**
```
collapse each community into a single super-node
edges between communities become edges between super-nodes
repeat Phase 1 on the aggregated network
```

**Modularity Formula:**
```
Q = (1/2m) × Σ [A_ij - (k_i × k_j)/(2m)] × δ(c_i, c_j)
```

The algorithm optimizes Q, which measures how much edge weight falls within communities versus what would be expected by random chance.

**Resolution Parameter:**
- `resolution = 1.0` (default): Balanced clusters, ~32 concepts
- `resolution = 0.5`: Coarse clusters, ~38 concepts (max cluster 64% of tokens)
- `resolution = 2.0`: Fine-grained clusters, ~79 concepts (max cluster 4.2% of tokens)

**Concept Naming:**
```python
top_members = sorted(cluster_members, key=lambda m: m.pagerank, reverse=True)[:3]
concept_name = '/'.join(top_members)  # e.g., "neural/learning/networks"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Enables concept-level search ("find documents about authentication")
- Reduces dimensionality while preserving semantic structure
- Creates Layer 2 (Concepts) that bridges raw terms and documents

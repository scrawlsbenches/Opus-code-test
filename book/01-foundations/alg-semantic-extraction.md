# Semantic Relation Extraction — Knowledge Graph Construction

**Purpose:** Extract typed relationships (IsA, PartOf, Causes) from document text.

**Implementation:** `cortical/semantics.py`

**Pattern-Based Extraction:**
24 regex patterns detect 10+ relation types:
```python
r'(\w+)\s+(?:is|are)\s+(?:a|an)\s+(?:type\s+of\s+)?(\w+)' → IsA (0.9 confidence)
r'(\w+)\s+(?:is|are)\s+(?:a\s+)?part\s+of' → PartOf (0.95 confidence)
r'(\w+)\s+(?:causes|leads?\s+to)' → Causes (0.9 confidence)
```

**Semantic Retrofitting:**
Blends co-occurrence weights with semantic relation knowledge:
```
new_weight = α × original_weight + (1-α) × semantic_target_weight
```
With α = 0.3, semantic signals dominate (70%) while preserving some corpus statistics (30%).

**Relation Weight Multipliers:**
| Relation | Weight | Semantics |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| SameAs | 2.0 | Strongest synonymy |
| IsA | 1.5 | Hypernymy |
| PartOf | 1.3 | Meronymy |
| RelatedTo | 0.8 | Generic |
| Antonym | -0.5 | Opposition |

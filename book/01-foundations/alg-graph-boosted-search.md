# Graph-Boosted Search (GB-BM25) — Hybrid Ranking

**Purpose:** Combine BM25 relevance with graph structure signals.

**Implementation:** `cortical/query/search.py:425-564`

**Scoring Formula:**
```
final_score = (0.5 × normalized_bm25) + (0.3 × normalized_pagerank) + (0.2 × normalized_proximity)
            × coverage_multiplier (0.5 to 1.5)
```

**Three Signal Sources:**

1. **BM25 Base Score (50%):**
   - Standard term frequency × inverse document frequency
   - Per-document scoring using `col.tfidf_per_doc`

2. **PageRank Boost (30%):**
   - Sum of matched term PageRanks
   - Rewards documents containing important terms

3. **Proximity Boost (20%):**
   - For each pair of original query terms:
     - Check if they're connected in the co-occurrence graph
     - If connected, boost documents containing both
   - Rewards documents where query terms appear together

**Coverage Multiplier:**
- Documents matching 1/5 query terms: 0.7× multiplier
- Documents matching all 5 query terms: 1.5× multiplier
- Prevents documents matching one rare term from outranking documents matching many terms

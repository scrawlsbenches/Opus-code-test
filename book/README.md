# The Cortical Chronicles

> *A self-documenting book generated by the Cortical Text Processor*

This book is **auto-generated** from the codebase. It grows with every commit.

## Chapters

- **00-preface/** - What this book is and how it works
- **01-foundations/** - Algorithm deep-dives (PageRank, BM25, Louvain, etc.)
- **02-architecture/** - Module documentation and dependency graphs
- **03-decisions/** - Architecture Decision Records
- **04-evolution/** - Project history told through commits
- **05-future/** - Roadmap and vision

## How It Works

This book uses the Cortical Text Processor to index and understand its own codebase.
Each chapter is generated by specialized generators that extract and transform
source code, documentation, and git history into readable content.

## Quick Start

### Regenerating the Full Book

```bash
# Full regeneration
python scripts/generate_book.py

# With verbose output
python scripts/generate_book.py --verbose

# Test without writing files
python scripts/generate_book.py --dry-run
```

### Regenerating a Single Chapter

```bash
# List available generators
python scripts/generate_book.py --list

# Regenerate specific chapter
python scripts/generate_book.py --chapter foundations
python scripts/generate_book.py --chapter architecture
python scripts/generate_book.py --chapter evolution

# Always rebuild search index after changes
python scripts/generate_book.py --chapter search
```

## Search

Open `index.html` for a searchable interface powered by semantic search.

### Need Help?

If something isn't working:

1. Run diagnostics: `python scripts/generate_book.py --dry-run --verbose`
2. Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for your error

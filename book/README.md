## How It Works

This book uses the Cortical Text Processor to index and understand its own codebase.
Each chapter is generated by specialized generators that extract and transform
source code, documentation, and git history into readable content.

## Regenerating

```bash
python scripts/generate_book.py
```

## Search

Open `index.html` for a searchable interface powered by semantic search.

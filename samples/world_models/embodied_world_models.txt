Embodied World Models

Embodied world models are internal representations grounded in sensorimotor experience and physical interaction with the environment. Embodiment emphasizes that cognition arises from the body's interactions with the world rather than abstract symbol manipulation. Embodied world models represent environmental dynamics in terms of action affordances, sensorimotor contingencies, and physical constraints experienced through bodily engagement.

Sensorimotor grounding means that conceptual knowledge in embodied world models is tied to patterns of sensory input and motor output. Rather than abstract symbols, embodied representations encode how perception changes with action. For example, an embodied representation of "graspable" encodes the visual features, reach distances, and grip configurations associated with successfully grasping objects. This grounding provides meaning through connection to physical experience.

Affordances are action possibilities that objects and environments offer to an embodied agent. An embodied world model represents affordances by encoding which actions are possible and what outcomes they produce in different situations. A chair affords sitting, a door affords opening, a ball affords throwing. Affordance representations capture the agent's understanding of action possibilities shaped by both environmental structure and bodily capabilities.

Forward models in embodied systems predict the sensory consequences of motor commands. When planning a movement, the motor system uses forward models to anticipate proprioceptive feedback and sensory outcomes. These predictions enable smooth motor control by detecting and correcting errors before they become large. Forward models are a type of embodied world model specialized for sensorimotor prediction and control.

Inverse models complement forward models by mapping desired sensory outcomes to motor commands that achieve them. Given a goal state like "hand at object location," the inverse model computes joint angles and muscle activations needed to reach that state. Inverse models solve motor planning problems using knowledge of body dynamics. Together, forward and inverse models enable skilled embodied interaction.

Embodied simulation is a cognitive process where understanding and reasoning involve reactivating sensorimotor patterns from prior experience. When humans think about hammering a nail, their motor system shows activation patterns similar to actual hammering. Embodied simulation suggests that world models include sensorimotor components that support understanding through mental reenactment of physical interactions.

Physical intuition emerges from embodied world models that capture physical regularities through experience. Without formal physics training, humans exhibit physical intuition about support, collision, containment, and other mechanical relationships. This intuition arises from embodied world models learned through manipulation and observation. Embodied physical intuition enables successful navigation and tool use in everyday environments.

Body schema is a form of embodied world model representing the configuration and capabilities of one's own body. The body schema tracks limb positions, body boundaries, and the relationship between motor commands and resulting movements. This self-model enables coordinated movement and tool use by providing awareness of bodily state and action possibilities. Body schema updates occur when body properties change, such as gaining skill or using tools.

Tool incorporation extends body schema to include manipulated objects as functional extensions of the body. When using a tool like a rake, embodied world models update to treat the tool as part of the body's action space. Skilled tool users experience tools as transparent extensions through which they directly feel and manipulate the world. This incorporation demonstrates the flexibility of embodied world models.

Embodied world models guide navigation through spatial environments by representing layouts, obstacles, and routes in egocentric or allocentric coordinates. Egocentric representations encode space relative to the body, supporting immediate action selection. Allocentric representations encode absolute spatial relationships independent of current position, supporting route planning and mental maps. Navigation world models integrate both egocentric and allocentric information.

Active perception emphasizes that perception is shaped by action, with embodied world models guiding information gathering. Rather than passively receiving sensory input, agents actively move sensors to gather relevant information. Eye movements scan scenes to fixate on informative regions, hands explore objects to determine their properties. Embodied world models predict how actions will change sensory input, enabling strategic information gathering.

Sensorimotor contingencies are the lawful relationships between actions and resulting sensory changes that characterize interaction with the environment. An embodied world model captures sensorimotor contingencies like "moving eyes rightward shifts retinal images leftward" or "pushing an object causes it to slide." Understanding these contingencies enables prediction and control. Some theories propose that conscious perception arises from implicit knowledge of sensorimotor contingencies.

Embodied world models in robotics enable physical robots to plan and execute complex manipulation tasks. Robot world models must accurately represent object properties, contact dynamics, and the effects of forces and torques. Learning accurate physical models from robot experience remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous state spaces and complex contact mechanics. Sim-to-real transfer approaches train models in simulation and adapt them to real physics.

Proprioception and interoception provide essential input to embodied world models. Proprioception senses body position and movement through muscle, tendon, and joint receptors. Interoception monitors internal physiological states like heart rate, respiration, and digestion. These sensory modalities inform world models about bodily state and needs, enabling regulation and motivated behavior. Embodied models integrate exteroceptive, proprioceptive, and interoceptive information.

Embodied cognition theories argue that abstract reasoning depends on metaphorical extensions of embodied experience. Abstract concepts like "support," "force," and "balance" originate in physical experience but extend to social, emotional, and intellectual domains. Embodied world models provide grounding for abstract thought through these metaphorical mappings. This perspective challenges traditional views of cognition as disembodied symbol manipulation.

Developmental acquisition of embodied world models begins with basic sensorimotor schemas in infancy and progressively refines through experience. Infants explore action-perception relationships through spontaneous movement and manipulation. This sensorimotor exploration builds world models that gradually incorporate physical principles, object permanence, and causal understanding. Developmental trajectories reveal the experiential foundations of embodied knowledge.

Morphological computation highlights how body structure simplifies control by offloading computation to physical dynamics. Embodied world models can be simpler when the body's physical properties naturally produce useful behaviors. For instance, a compliant arm naturally absorbs contact forces without requiring complex control. Understanding morphological computation informs the design of both biological and artificial embodied agents.

Virtual embodiment extends embodied world models to virtual environments where agents have simulated bodies. Despite the lack of physical interaction, virtual embodiment can produce similar cognitive and behavioral effects as physical embodiment. Virtual reality users often experience presence and agency through virtual bodies. This demonstrates that embodied world models depend on sensorimotor contingencies rather than necessarily requiring physical substrates.

Embodied world models face unique challenges in representing complex contact-rich interactions like grasping, stacking, or fluid dynamics. These interactions involve high-dimensional continuous states, discontinuous transitions, and sensitivity to small variations. Accurate embodied models of contact mechanics require sophisticated representations and substantial data. Advances in simulation and learning methods continue to improve embodied model capabilities.

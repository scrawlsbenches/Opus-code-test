# Downhill Mountain Biking: Techniques and Equipment

## Introduction

Downhill mountain biking descends technical terrain at speed, combining bike handling skills with courage and fitness. From lift-served bike parks to remote backcountry descents, the discipline pushes the boundaries of what's possible on two wheels.

## Equipment

### Frame Geometry

**Key Measurements:**

**Head Angle:**
- Downhill: 62-65°
- Slacker = more stable at speed
- Steeper = more responsive

**Reach:**
- Horizontal distance from BB to head tube
- Longer reach = more room, speed stability
- 460-500mm typical for DH

**Wheelbase:**
- Total length between axles
- Longer = stable, less nimble
- 1200-1300mm for DH bikes

**Bottom Bracket Height:**
- Lower = better cornering stability
- Higher = better rock clearance
- -20 to +10mm relative to axles

### Suspension

**Fork:**
- 180-200mm travel
- Dual crown for strength
- Compression and rebound adjustment
- Air or coil spring

**Rear Shock:**
- 200-250mm rear travel
- Coil preferred for consistency
- High-speed/low-speed damping
- Linkage design varies

**Setup Principles:**
- Sag: 25-30% of travel
- Rebound: Fastest without packing
- Compression: Personal preference

### Wheels and Tires

**Wheel Size:**
- 27.5": Nimble, accelerates fast
- 29": Rolls over obstacles, stable
- Mullet (29/27.5): Combination

**Tires:**
- Width: 2.4-2.6" typical
- Casing: DH casing for puncture resistance
- Compound: Soft = grip, Hard = durability
- Front: Aggressive knobs
- Rear: Faster rolling, still grippy

**Pressures:**
- Lower = more grip, more flats
- Tubeless required
- 22-28 psi typical range
- Inserts for rim protection

### Protective Gear

**Essential:**
- Full-face helmet (certified)
- Goggles
- Knee pads
- Gloves

**Recommended:**
- Back protector
- Neck brace
- Elbow pads
- Body armor (chest, shoulders)

## Fundamental Techniques

### Attack Position

**The Ready Position:**
- Pedals level
- Knees and elbows bent
- Weight centered over bike
- One finger on brakes
- Eyes looking ahead

**Low Position:**
- Hips back and down
- Chest low
- Absorbing terrain
- For steep or fast sections

### Braking

**Principles:**
- Brake before turns, not in them
- 70% front, 30% rear (varies)
- Progressive application
- Avoid skidding (lose control)

**Techniques:**
- Trail braking: Light brakes into corner
- Pump for speed: Off brakes in transitions
- Rear-wheel steering: Intentional slides

### Cornering

**Body Position:**
- Outside foot down and weighted
- Inside knee out, pointing into turn
- Bike leaned, body more upright
- Weight low and forward

**Line Selection:**
- Outside-inside-outside (when possible)
- Late apex for control
- Look through the turn
- Adjust for surface conditions

**Surface Adaptation:**
- Loose: Weight back, wider line
- Roots/rocks: Pick path carefully
- Bermed: Use full banking
- Off-camber: Caution, commitment

### Jumping

**Takeoff:**
- Compress into lip
- Extend through jump
- Bike and body synchronized
- Don't pull up (let jump lift you)

**In Air:**
- Stay neutral for small jumps
- Scrub (push down) to stay low
- Whip/style for flair
- Prepare for landing

**Landing:**
- Match bike angle to slope
- Both wheels together (ideally)
- Compress to absorb
- Drive out of landing

### Drops

**Approach:**
- Steady speed (not too slow)
- Attack position
- Commit mentally

**Execution:**
- Push bike away at lip
- Level out in air
- Spot landing
- Compress on impact

**Common Errors:**
- Too slow (nose-dive)
- Pulling up (loop out)
- Target fixation

## Trail Features

### Rock Gardens

**Technique:**
- Stay loose (let bike move)
- Light grip, heavy feet
- Pick general line, don't overthink
- Momentum helps

### Roots

**Wet Roots:**
- Extremely slippery
- Cross perpendicular
- Weight centered
- Light braking before, not on

### Steep Terrain

**Body Position:**
- Hips way back
- One foot forward (dropper position)
- Controlled braking
- Look far ahead

**Line Choice:**
- Ruts can guide
- Avoid loose off-camber
- Fall line often safest

### Gap Jumps

**Preparation:**
- Know your speed requirement
- Walk the landing first
- Start with smaller gaps
- Have an abort option

## Fitness

### Physical Demands

**Grip Strength:**
- Forearms fatigue first
- Death grip = faster fatigue
- Training helps

**Core Stability:**
- Constant stabilization
- Bike-body separation
- Injury prevention

**Leg Strength:**
- Absorbing impacts
- Maintaining position
- Pedaling between features

### Training

**On-Bike:**
- Volume of descending
- Skill-specific practice
- Variety of trails

**Off-Bike:**
- Grip training (dead hangs)
- Core work (planks, stability)
- Leg strength (squats, deadlifts)
- Cardio for recovery between runs

## Safety

### Risk Management

**Know Your Limits:**
- Session features before full speed
- Walk unfamiliar terrain
- Build up incrementally

**Ride with Others:**
- Help in crashes
- Spot features
- Share knowledge

### Common Injuries

**Prevention:**
- Proper warm-up
- Adequate rest
- Appropriate progression
- Quality protective gear

**Emergency Preparedness:**
- First aid knowledge
- Communication device
- Know evacuation routes

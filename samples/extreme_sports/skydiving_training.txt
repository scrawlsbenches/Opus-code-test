# Skydiving: Training, Techniques, and Safety

## Introduction

Skydiving—the act of jumping from an aircraft and freefalling before deploying a parachute—combines exhilaration with technical skill and rigorous safety protocols. From first tandem jumps to advanced disciplines like wingsuit flying, the sport offers progressive challenges and community.

## Learning Progression

### First Jump Options

**Tandem Skydiving:**
- Attached to certified instructor
- Minimal training (15-30 minutes)
- Full freefall and canopy experience
- Most common introduction

**Static Line/IAD:**
- Solo jump with automatic deployment
- Ground training (4-6 hours)
- Gradual progression to freefall
- Traditional training method

**Accelerated Freefall (AFF):**
- Solo freefall from first jump
- Two instructors in freefall
- Intensive ground training (6-8 hours)
- Fastest path to solo jumping

### Student Progression (AFF)

**Levels 1-3: Basic Body Position**
- Arch position fundamentals
- Altitude awareness
- Practice pulls
- Two instructor jumps

**Levels 4-7: Maneuvers**
- Turns (90°, 360°)
- Forward and backward movement
- Solo stability
- One instructor, then solo

**Post-AFF Requirements:**
- 25 jumps for A-License
- Coach jumps for specific skills
- Written and practical tests
- Canopy skills demonstration

### License System (USPA)

**A-License:**
- 25 jumps minimum
- Basic freefall and canopy skills
- Jump solo, no supervision required

**B-License:**
- 50 jumps
- Water training
- Night jump and additional skills

**C-License:**
- 200 jumps
- Can perform demonstrations
- Additional maneuvers

**D-License:**
- 500 jumps
- Highest rating
- Can become instructor/examiner

## Body Position

### Basic Stable (Belly-to-Earth)

**Arch Position:**
- Hips pressed forward
- Arms at 90° (like holding beach ball)
- Legs extended, slight bend
- Head up, looking at horizon

**Common Errors:**
- Flat body (no arch)
- Arms too high or low
- Legs together
- Looking down

### Turns

**Principles:**
- Lower shoulder in turn direction
- Opposite knee drops
- Maintain arch
- Smoothness over speed

**Execution:**
- 90° turns first
- Progress to 360°
- Practice both directions
- Stop turns precisely

### Movement

**Forward Movement:**
- Arms back (delta position)
- De-arch slightly
- Head down
- Like flying downhill

**Backward Movement:**
- Arms forward (cup air)
- Increase arch
- Head up
- Like flying uphill

### Tracking

Horizontal movement across sky.

**Body Position:**
- Arms back, tight to body
- Legs straight, together
- Slight de-arch
- Delta wing shape

**Purpose:**
- Separation before deployment
- Group breakoff
- Fun skill to develop

## Canopy Skills

### Deployment Sequence

**Wave-off:** Signal to others (altitude 5,500-6,000 ft)
**Track:** Separation from others
**Pull:** Deploy main at 4,000-5,500 ft (students higher)
**Check:** Verify good canopy
**Navigate:** Orient to landing area

### Canopy Control

**Toggles:**
- Primary steering
- Pull both for brakes
- One for turns
- Flare for landing

**Rear Risers:**
- Faster response
- Used in flight, not landing
- More advanced technique

**Front Risers:**
- Dive canopy faster
- Advanced maneuvers
- Swooping technique

### Landing Pattern

**Downwind Leg:**
Parallel to runway, with wind.

**Base Leg:**
Perpendicular to runway.

**Final Approach:**
Into wind, toward target.

**Flare:**
Both toggles down to stop forward speed and descend gently.

### Emergency Procedures

**Malfunction Recognition:**
- Line twists (minor, try to kick out)
- Tension knots (minor to serious)
- Bag lock (serious)
- Horseshoe (serious)
- Streamer/partial deployment (serious)

**Decision Altitude:**
1,800-2,500 ft (hard deck)—must have good canopy or initiate emergency procedures.

**Cutaway Procedure:**
1. Arch (stable body position)
2. Look at cutaway handle
3. Peel, punch cutaway handle
4. Look at reserve handle
5. Pull reserve handle
6. Check canopy

### AAD (Automatic Activation Device)

Fires reserve if still in freefall at set altitude.

**Types:**
- Cypres (most common)
- Vigil
- Mars

**Settings:**
- Student mode: Higher activation
- Expert mode: Lower activation
- Must be serviced regularly

## Equipment

### Main Parachute

**Components:**
- Container (holds everything)
- Main canopy (ram-air wing)
- Deployment system (pilot chute, bridle, deployment bag)
- Steering toggles

**Sizing:**
Wing loading = Exit weight / Canopy size (sq ft)
- Students: 0.7-0.9 lb/sq ft
- Intermediate: 0.9-1.1 lb/sq ft
- Expert: 1.1-1.5+ lb/sq ft

### Reserve Parachute

- Packed by certified rigger
- Must be repacked every 180 days
- More conservative design
- Always reliable

### Altimeter

**Types:**
- Analog (wrist or chest mount)
- Digital
- Audible (in helmet)

**Importance:**
Critical for altitude awareness—check frequently.

## Safety Culture

### Pre-Jump Preparation

**Gear Check:**
- Handles visible and secure
- AAD on and calibrated
- Pins and closing loops
- Toggles stowed

**Exit Check:**
- Aircraft position
- Spot (exit point)
- Separation from others
- Winds aloft

### Weather Limitations

**Student Limits:**
- Winds <14 mph
- No clouds below jump altitude
- Good visibility
- No precipitation

### Incident Response

**If Something Goes Wrong:**
- Remain calm
- Follow training
- Execute emergency procedures
- Altitude awareness critical

**Post-Incident:**
- Report to S&TA (Safety & Training Advisor)
- Equipment inspection
- Debriefing and learning

## Advanced Disciplines

### Formation Skydiving (FS)

- Building formations with others
- Sequential patterns

### Wingsuit Flying

- Fabric between arms and legs
- Horizontal flight
- Requires 200+ jumps
- BASE jumping progression

### Canopy Piloting (Swooping)

- High-performance landings

Deep learning has revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling machines
to learn hierarchical representations directly from raw data. Convolutional
neural networks excel at image recognition by detecting edges in early layers
and combining them into increasingly complex features in deeper layers. This
hierarchical processing mirrors the visual cortex, where simple cells detect
edges and complex cells respond to more abstract patterns. The breakthrough
came when researchers realized that deep networks with many layers could
automatically discover the feature hierarchies that scientists had previously
designed by hand. Backpropagation allows these networks to learn by adjusting
millions of parameters to minimize prediction errors. Today, deep learning
powers everything from voice assistants to autonomous vehicles.

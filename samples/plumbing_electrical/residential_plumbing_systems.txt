# Residential Plumbing Systems: Design and Installation

## Introduction

Plumbing systems deliver clean water and remove waste safely. Understanding residential plumbing enables proper installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting while ensuring compliance with building codes and health standards.

## Water Supply System

### Service Line

**Components:**
- Main shutoff at street (utility side)
- Water meter
- Main shutoff at house
- Pressure reducing valve (if needed)

**Sizing:**
Service line sized for peak demand. Typical residential: 3/4" to 1" diameter.

**Materials:**
- Copper (Type K, L, or M)
- PEX (cross-linked polyethylene)
- CPVC (chlorinated PVC)
- Galvanized steel (older homes)
- PE (polyethylene) for underground

### Distribution System

**Layout Types:**

**Trunk and Branch:**
- Large main line (trunk) with smaller branches
- Traditional approach
- Longer wait for hot water at distant fixtures

**Home Run (Manifold):**
- Individual PEX lines from central manifold
- Faster hot water delivery
- More material but easier to troubleshoot

**Hybrid:**
- Combination of approaches
- Trunk to areas, manifold within areas

### Pipe Sizing

Based on fixture units and developed length.

**Minimum Pipe Sizes:**
| Fixture | Supply Line |
|---------|-------------|
| Lavatory | 1/2" |
| Kitchen sink | 1/2" |
| Shower | 1/2" |
| Toilet | 3/8" |
| Washing machine | 1/2" |
| Dishwasher | 3/8" |

**Main Lines:**
- 3/4" serves most homes
- 1" for larger homes or long runs

### Water Pressure

**Ideal Range:** 40-80 psi
**Maximum Allowed:** 80 psi (per most codes)

**Low Pressure Causes:**
- Undersized pipes
- Corroded pipes
- High elevation
- Supply issues

**High Pressure Solutions:**
- Pressure reducing valve (PRV)
- Set to 50-60 psi typical

### Hot Water System

**Water Heater Types:**
- Tank (storage): 40-80 gallon typical
- Tankless (on-demand): Higher flow rate requirements
- Heat pump: Energy efficient
- Solar: Supplemental heating

**Hot Water Distribution:**
- Recirculation system: Dedicated return line
- Demand pump: Activated by button/motion
- Point-of-use: Small heaters at fixtures

## Drain-Waste-Vent (DWV) System

### Drain Pipes

Carry wastewater by gravity.

**Sizing by Fixture Units:**
| Fixture | Drainage Fixture Units |
|---------|----------------------|
| Lavatory | 1 |
| Toilet | 4 |
| Bathtub | 2 |
| Shower | 2 |
| Kitchen sink | 2 |
| Washing machine | 2 |
| Floor drain | 2 |

**Minimum Pipe Sizes:**
- Lavatory: 1-1/4"
- Bathtub/shower: 1-1/2"
- Kitchen sink: 1-1/2"
- Toilet: 3" (branch), 3-4" (main)
- Building drain: 4"

### Traps

Water seal preventing sewer gas entry.

**P-Trap:**
- Standard under sinks, tubs
- 2-4" water seal required

**S-Trap (prohibited):**
- Can siphon dry
- Replaced with P-trap

**Trap Requirements:**
- Within 24" of fixture (horizontally)
- Proper venting to maintain seal
- Accessible for cleaning

### Vent System

Allows air into drain system for proper flow and trap seal maintenance.

**Vent Types:**

**Individual Vent:**
- Serves single fixture
- Rises vertically from drain

**Common Vent:**
- Serves two fixtures on same level
- Back-to-back arrangement

**Wet Vent:**
- Drain pipe serves as vent for upstream fixtures
- Carefully sized

**Loop Vent:**
- Returns to stack before rising through roof
- Islands and special situations

**Air Admittance Valve (AAV):**
- One-way valve admitting air
- Code restrictions vary
- Not a replacement for primary vent

### Slope Requirements

**Horizontal Drains:**
- 1-1/4" to 3" pipe: 1/4" per foot
- 4" and larger: 1/8" per foot minimum

Too little slope: Solids accumulate
Too much slope: Liquids outrun solids

## Installation Best Practices

### Support and Hanging

**Horizontal Pipes:**
- Copper: Every 6-10 feet
- PEX: Every 32 inches (4 feet for cold)
- PVC/ABS: Every 4 feet

**Vertical Pipes:**
- Support at each floor
- Base support for risers

### Connections

**Copper:**
- Solder (sweat) joints
- Compression fittings
- Push-fit (SharkBite)

**PEX:**
- Crimp rings
- Expansion fittings
- Push-fit

**PVC/ABS:**
- Solvent cement (glue)
- Proper primer required for PVC

### Penetrations

**Fire Stopping:**
Required where pipes penetrate fire-rated assemblies.

**Sleeves:**
Allow for pipe movement and thermal expansion.

**Escutcheons:**
Cover wall/floor penetrations neatly.

## Testing

### Water Supply

**Pressure Test:**
- Plug all outlets
- Pressurize to 50-100 psi
- Hold for specified time (often 15 minutes)
- Check for leaks

### DWV System

**Water Test:**
- Plug lowest drain
- Fill system to flood level rim
- 15-minute minimum
- Check for leaks

**Air Test:**
- 5 psi air pressure
- Hold for 15 minutes
- Soap solution reveals leaks

## Code Compliance

### Common Code Requirements

- Potable water protection (backflow prevention)
- Trap and vent requirements
- Proper pipe materials for application
- Access panels for valves and cleanouts
- Permit and inspection requirements

### Backflow Prevention

**Devices:**
- Air gap: Most reliable (2× diameter above flood rim)
- Atmospheric vacuum breaker
- Pressure vacuum breaker
- Reduced pressure zone (RPZ)

**Required Locations:**
- Hose bibbs
- Sprinkler connections
- Boiler makeup
- Any cross-connection risk

# Welding Fundamentals: Processes and Techniques

## Introduction

Welding joins metals by melting and fusing them together, often with added filler material. Understanding welding processes, metallurgy, and safety enables strong, reliable joints for fabrication, repair, and construction.

## Arc Welding Processes

### Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW/Stick)

**Process:**
Electric arc between consumable electrode and workpiece. Flux coating provides shielding gas and slag.

**Equipment:**
- Welding machine (AC, DC, or AC/DC)
- Electrode holder (stinger)
- Ground clamp
- Welding helmet
- Electrodes

**Electrode Classification (AWS):**
E7018: E = Electrode, 70 = 70,000 psi tensile, 1 = all position, 8 = coating/current type

**Common Electrodes:**
| Type | Characteristics | Applications |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| E6010 | Deep penetration, DC+ | Root passes, dirty metal |
| E6011 | Similar to 6010, AC/DC | Root passes, general |
| E6013 | Shallow penetration | Sheet metal, beginners |
| E7014 | Iron powder, high deposition | Flat/horizontal fill |
| E7018 | Low hydrogen, DC+ or AC | Structural, all positions |

**Technique:**
- Strike arc like match (scratch) or tap
- Maintain arc length (equal to electrode diameter)
- Travel speed: Watch puddle, not arc
- Angle: 10-15° drag angle

### Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW/MIG)

**Process:**
Continuous wire electrode fed through gun. Shielding gas from external source protects weld.

**Equipment:**
- Power source (CV)
- Wire feeder
- Welding gun
- Shielding gas supply
- Ground clamp

**Shielding Gases:**
- CO2: Deep penetration, economical, more spatter
- 75/25 (Ar/CO2): General purpose steel
- 100% Argon: Aluminum, stainless
- Tri-mix: Specialty applications

**Transfer Modes:**

**Short Circuit:**
- Low heat, low spatter
- Thin materials
- All positions
- Lower deposition rate

**Globular:**
- Higher current than short circuit
- Large droplets, gravity-driven
- Flat/horizontal only
- More spatter

**Spray Transfer:**
- High current, high deposition
- Flat/horizontal only
- Clean, minimal spatter
- Requires higher argon mix

**Pulsed Spray:**
- Alternates high/low current
- All positions
- Controls heat input
- Requires advanced power source

### Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW/TIG)

**Process:**
Non-consumable tungsten electrode creates arc. Separate filler rod added manually. Inert gas shield.

**Equipment:**
- Power source (CC, AC/DC)
- TIG torch with tungsten
- Argon gas supply
- Filler rods
- Foot pedal (amperage control)

**Tungsten Types:**
- Pure (green): AC aluminum
- 2% thoriated (red): DC steel, stainless
- 2% ceriated (gray): AC/DC, all-purpose
- 2% lanthanated (blue): Similar to ceriated

**Technique:**
- Hold torch like pencil, 15-20° angle
- Dab filler into leading edge of puddle
- Maintain short arc length (1/8" or less)
- Gas post-flow protects cooling weld

**Applications:**
- Thin materials
- Critical joints (aerospace, nuclear)
- Aluminum, stainless, exotic alloys
- Root passes for pipe

### Flux-Cored Arc Welding (FCAW)

**Process:**
Tubular wire with flux core. Self-shielded (no external gas) or gas-shielded.

**Applications:**
- Outdoor welding (wind tolerance)
- High deposition rates
- Structural steel
- Shipbuilding

## Joint Design

### Basic Joint Types

**Butt Joint:**
Two pieces aligned edge-to-edge.
- Groove preparations: Square, V, U, J, double-V
- Full penetration for strength

**T-Joint:**
One piece perpendicular to another.
- Fillet welds typical
- Watch for lamellar tearing in thick material

**Lap Joint:**
Overlapping pieces.
- Fillet welds on one or both sides
- Double lap for strength

**Corner Joint:**
Pieces meet at angle.
- Open or closed corner
- Fillet or groove welds

**Edge Joint:**
Edges of two pieces joined.
- Limited strength
- Typically thin material

### Weld Types

**Fillet Weld:**
Triangular cross-section joining perpendicular surfaces.
- Size specified by leg dimension
- Throat determines strength

**Groove Weld:**
Fills prepared groove between pieces.
- Complete Joint Penetration (CJP)
- Partial Joint Penetration (PJP)

## Weld Quality

### Defects

**Porosity:**
Gas pockets trapped in weld.
- Causes: Contamination, improper shielding, wet electrode
- Prevention: Clean base metal, proper gas coverage

**Undercut:**
Groove melted into base metal at toe.
- Causes: Excessive current, wrong angle, fast travel
- Prevention: Adjust parameters, technique

**Lack of Fusion:**
Weld metal doesn't fuse to base metal.
- Causes: Cold weld, wrong angle, contamination
- Prevention: Increase heat, proper technique

**Cracking:**
Fractures in weld or HAZ.
- Hot cracking: Solidification issues
- Cold cracking: Hydrogen + stress
- Prevention: Proper filler, preheat, post-weld treatment

**Incomplete Penetration:**
Root doesn't fully fuse.
- Causes: Low heat, improper joint prep
- Prevention: Proper gap, root face, technique

### Inspection Methods

**Visual:** First-line inspection for surface defects

**Dye Penetrant:** Surface crack detection

**Magnetic Particle:** Surface/near-surface in ferrous metals

**Radiography (X-ray):** Internal defects

**Ultrasonic:** Internal defects, thickness measurement

## Safety

### Personal Protective Equipment

**Welding Helmet:**
- Auto-darkening or fixed shade
- Shade 10-13 for arc welding
- Protection from UV/IR and spatter

**Clothing:**
- Flame-resistant jacket/shirt
- Leather gloves
- Leather boots (no sneakers)
- Cap or hood for overhead work

**Respiratory:**
- Ventilation essential
- Respirator for confined spaces or toxic metals

### Hazards

**Arc Flash:** Eye damage from UV
**Burns:** Hot metal, spatter, UV
**Fumes:** Metal oxide fumes, hexavalent chromium (stainless)
**Fire:** Sparks, hot slag, cutting
**Electric Shock:** Faulty equipment, wet conditions
**Confined Space:** Oxygen depletion, fume buildup

Secure Software Development Lifecycle

The Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) integrates security practices into every phase of software creation. Rather than treating security as an afterthought, SSDLC embeds threat modeling, secure coding, and vulnerability testing from requirements through deployment. This shift-left approach catches vulnerabilities when they're cheapest to fix.

Requirements phase establishes security objectives alongside functional requirements. Security user stories capture authentication needs, data protection requirements, and compliance constraints. Abuse cases document how attackers might misuse the system. These artifacts inform later threat modeling and testing activities.

Design phase applies secure architecture patterns. Defense in depth layers multiple controls so single failures don't compromise security. Principle of least privilege restricts access to minimum necessary permissions. Input validation boundaries define where untrusted data enters the system. Cryptographic decisions specify algorithms, key management, and certificate handling.

Implementation phase follows secure coding standards. Developers use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting, and proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information. Code review catches logic flaws and validates security control implementation. Static analysis tools identify common vulnerability patterns automatically.

Testing phase verifies security controls work as designed. Unit tests exercise input validation and access control logic. Integration tests verify authentication flows and session management. Dynamic application security testing (DAST) probes running applications for vulnerabilities. Penetration testing simulates real attacks against the complete system.

Deployment phase ensures secure configuration in production. Secrets management provides credentials without hardcoding. Infrastructure as code enables consistent, auditable deployments. Monitoring and logging capture security events for incident response. Vulnerability scanning continues throughout the operational lifetime.

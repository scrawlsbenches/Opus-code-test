Letterpress printing transfers ink from raised metal or wood type surfaces
directly onto paper under impression pressure. Compositors arrange individual
sorts from typecase compartments into composing sticks, building lines of
justified text character by character. Leading strips separate lines while
em-quads and en-spaces create word gaps and indentation.

Typefaces display distinctive anatomy: serifs terminate strokes on Garamond
and Caslon while sans-serif Futura and Helvetica present clean unadorned
letterforms. X-height proportions, stroke contrast, and counter openness
distinguish typeface personalities. Point size measures type body height;
pica measurements organize page layouts with six picas per inch.

Platen presses clamp paper against inked forme in vertical motion while
cylinder presses roll sheets across horizontal typebeds. Makeready adjusts
impression evenness through tissue underlays compensating for uneven type
heights. Polymer photoplates now complement traditional foundry type, enabling
photographic reproduction at letterpress quality. Printers ink rollers,
carefully mixing pantone colors and adjusting tack for optimal transfer onto
cotton rag papers prized for dimensional impression.

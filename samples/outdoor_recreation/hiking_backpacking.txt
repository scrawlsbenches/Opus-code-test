# Hiking and Backpacking: Skills and Preparation

## Introduction

Hiking and backpacking connect people with wilderness through self-propelled travel. From day hikes to multi-week expeditions, these activities require preparation, skills, and respect for natural environments. Proper planning ensures safe, enjoyable experiences.

## Trip Planning

### Route Selection

**Considerations:**
- Distance and elevation gain
- Technical difficulty
- Water availability
- Permit requirements
- Season and conditions
- Escape routes
- Group experience level

**Information Sources:**
- Guidebooks and maps
- Ranger stations
- Trip reports (online communities)
- Satellite imagery
- Weather forecasts

### Leave No Trace Principles

1. **Plan Ahead and Prepare:** Know regulations, weather, terrain
2. **Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces:** Stay on trails, use established sites
3. **Dispose of Waste Properly:** Pack out trash, bury human waste
4. **Leave What You Find:** Preserve nature for others
5. **Minimize Campfire Impacts:** Use stoves, existing fire rings
6. **Respect Wildlife:** Observe from distance, store food properly
7. **Be Considerate of Others:** Share trails, minimize noise

### Permits and Regulations

**Common Requirements:**
- Wilderness permits (quota systems)
- Backcountry camping permits
- Bear canister requirements
- Fire restrictions
- Group size limits

**Obtaining Permits:**
- Online reservation systems
- Walk-up availability
- Ranger station pickup
- Planning months ahead for popular areas

## The Ten Essentials

### Modern List (Systems Approach)

1. **Navigation:** Map, compass, GPS, route description
2. **Sun Protection:** Sunscreen, sunglasses, hat, lip balm
3. **Insulation:** Extra clothing for worst conditions
4. **Illumination:** Headlamp with extra batteries
5. **First Aid:** Kit appropriate for trip length and group
6. **Fire:** Matches/lighter and fire starter
7. **Repair:** Multi-tool, duct tape, gear repair supplies
8. **Nutrition:** Extra food beyond planned meals
9. **Hydration:** Water and treatment method
10. **Emergency Shelter:** Bivy, space blanket, or tarp

## Gear Selection

### Footwear

**Types:**
- Trail runners: Light, fast drying, less support
- Hiking shoes: More support, moderate weight
- Hiking boots: Maximum support, heavier
- Mountaineering boots: Technical terrain, crampon compatible

**Fit:**
- Snug heel, room for toes
- Try on with hiking socks
- Walk downhill to check
- Break in before long trips

### Pack Selection

**Day Hiking:** 15-30 liters
**Weekend Backpacking:** 35-50 liters
**Extended Trips:** 50-70+ liters

**Fit Considerations:**
- Torso length (not height)
- Hip belt fit
- Load lifters and stabilizers
- Frame type (internal/external)

### Shelter Options

**Tents:**
- Double-wall: Vestibule, weather protection
- Single-wall: Lighter, condensation risk
- Freestanding vs. non-freestanding

**Alternatives:**
- Tarps: Ultralight, requires skill
- Hammocks: Comfortable, weight varies
- Bivies: Minimalist emergency/solo

**Weight vs. Comfort:**
- Ultralight: <2 lbs, compromises space/features
- Lightweight: 2-4 lbs, good balance
- Comfort: 4+ lbs, roomier

### Sleep System

**Sleeping Bags:**
- Down: Light, compressible, loses insulation when wet
- Synthetic: Heavier, bulkier, works when wet
- Temperature ratings (comfort vs. survival)

**Sleeping Pads:**
- Closed-cell foam: Cheap, durable, not compressible
- Air pads: Comfortable, compact, puncture risk
- R-value: Insulation rating (higher = warmer)

### Cooking Systems

**Stove Types:**
- Canister: Convenient, consistent, cold weather issues
- Alcohol: Cheap, simple, slow
- Wood-burning: No fuel to carry, fire regulations
- Solid fuel (Esbit): Lightweight backup

**Cookware:**
- Size based on group and meals
- Titanium: Lightest, expensive
- Aluminum: Good value, lighter
- Steel: Durable, heavy

## On-Trail Skills

### Navigation

**Map Reading:**
- Terrain association
- Contour interpretation
- Distance estimation
- Feature identification

**Compass Use:**
- Taking bearings
- Following bearings
- Declination adjustment
- Triangulation

**GPS:**
- Waypoint marking
- Track following
- Battery management
- Always carry backup

### Water Treatment

**Methods:**
- Filtration: Removes bacteria, protozoa
- Chemical (tablets, drops): Lightweight, slower
- UV (SteriPen): Fast, battery dependent
- Boiling: Reliable, time and fuel intensive

**Sources:**
- Flowing preferred over still
- Spring sources cleanest
- Avoid downstream of campsites or grazing

### Weather Awareness

**Signs of Weather Change:**
- Cloud types and movement
- Barometric pressure changes
- Wind direction shifts
- Animal behavior

**Storm Response:**
- Descend from exposed areas
- Avoid ridgelines and tall trees
- Seek lower terrain
- Wait out if necessary

## Safety Considerations

### Wildlife

**Bear Safety:**
- Proper food storage (canisters, hangs)
- Clean camp cooking
- Awareness while hiking
- Knowledge of bear behavior

**Other Wildlife:**
- Mountain lions: Make noise, don't run
- Snakes: Watch step, give space
- Insects: Repellent, protective clothing, tick checks

### First Aid

**Common Issues:**
- Blisters: Prevention, treatment, taping
- Sprains: RICE protocol
- Hypothermia: Recognition, rewarming
- Heat illness: Hydration, cooling, rest
- Altitude sickness: Recognize, descend if severe

### Emergency Preparedness

**Communication:**
- Satellite messengers (inReach, SPOT)
- Cell phone (limited coverage)
- Trip itinerary with contact

**Self-Rescue:**
- When to wait, when to move
- Signaling techniques
- Navigation without tools

## Nutrition and Hydration

### Caloric Needs

**Backpacking Burns:**
- 3,000-5,000 calories per day
- More in cold weather
- More at altitude

**Food Planning:**
- 1.5-2 lbs per person per day
- 100-125 calories per ounce target
- Balance carbs, protein, fat

### Meal Strategies

**Breakfast:**
- Quick, high-energy
- Instant oatmeal, bars, pop-tarts

**Lunch:**
- Snacking through day
- Nuts, cheese, dried fruit, jerky
- Tortillas with fillings

**Dinner:**
- Hot meal for morale
- Dehydrated meals
- Pasta, rice, couscous bases

### Hydration

**Requirements:**
- 3-4 liters per day minimum
- More in heat, altitude, exertion
- Monitor urine color

**Strategy:**
- Drink before thirsty
- Electrolyte supplementation
- Know water source locations

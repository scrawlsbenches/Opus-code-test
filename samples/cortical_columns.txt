The neocortex is organized into cortical columns, vertical structures that
span all six layers of cortical tissue. Each column contains approximately
ten thousand neurons and functions as a basic computational unit. Within
columns, minicolumns of about one hundred neurons fire together in response
to specific features. This columnar organization appears throughout sensory
and motor cortex, suggesting a universal algorithm for cortical computation.
Lateral connections between columns enable contextual processing and pattern
completion. When you see part of an object, these connections help activate
the full representation based on learned associations. Understanding cortical
columns could unlock principles for building more intelligent machines.

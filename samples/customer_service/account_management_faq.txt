Account Management FAQ

Q: How do I create a new account?
A: Visit our website homepage and click the "Sign Up" button. Provide your email address, create a strong password with at least 8 characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Verify your email by clicking the link sent to your inbox within 24 hours. Complete your profile with billing information to activate full account features. Two-factor authentication is recommended for enhanced security.

Q: I forgot my password. How can I reset it?
A: Click "Forgot Password" on the login page and enter your registered email address. Check your inbox for a password reset link valid for 2 hours. Click the link and create a new password meeting our security requirements. If you don't receive the email within 10 minutes, check your spam folder or request another reset link. For security reasons, we cannot tell you your current password - it must be reset.

Q: How do I enable two-factor authentication?
A: Navigate to Account Settings and select Security Options. Choose your preferred 2FA method: authenticator app (recommended), SMS text message, or email code. Follow the setup wizard to configure your chosen method. Save backup codes in a secure location in case you lose access to your primary 2FA device. Once enabled, you'll need both your password and verification code to log in.

Q: Can I change my registered email address?
A: Yes, go to Account Settings and click "Change Email Address" under Contact Information. Enter your new email and confirm your current password. A verification link will be sent to both your old and new email addresses. Click the link in your new email within 24 hours to complete the change. Your old email will receive a notification confirming the change for security purposes.

Q: How do I update my billing information?
A: Log into your account dashboard and select Billing & Payment from the menu. Click "Update Payment Method" to modify credit card details, billing address, or payment preferences. Changes take effect immediately for future charges. Previous invoices remain unchanged. We use industry-standard encryption to protect all payment information. Card details are never displayed in full for security reasons.

Q: What information is stored in my account profile?
A: Your profile contains contact information (name, email, phone), billing details (payment methods, billing address), subscription information (plan type, renewal date), purchase history, communication preferences, and usage data for personalization. You can view, download, or delete your personal data through the Privacy Dashboard in Account Settings. We comply with GDPR and CCPA privacy regulations.

Q: How do I delete my account permanently?
A: Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Navigate to Account Settings and scroll to the bottom for "Delete Account" option. You'll be asked to confirm your password and provide feedback about your decision. All personal data will be deleted within 30 days per our data retention policy. Active subscriptions will be cancelled, and any remaining balance will be forfeited unless you request a refund before deletion.

Q: Can I have multiple accounts?
A: Our Terms of Service permit one personal account per individual. Business accounts or family accounts may include multiple user profiles under a single subscription. Creating duplicate accounts to abuse promotions, free trials, or circumvent restrictions is prohibited and may result in account suspension. If you need separate accounts for personal and business use, contact our sales team about enterprise options.

Q: Why is my account locked or suspended?
A: Accounts may be locked due to multiple failed login attempts (unlocks automatically after 30 minutes), suspicious activity detected by our security systems, payment failures for active subscriptions, or Terms of Service violations. Check your email for notifications explaining the reason and instructions for resolution. Contact customer support if you believe your account was locked in error. Serious violations may result in permanent account termination.

Q: How do I export my account data?
A: We provide data portability rights under privacy regulations. Go to Privacy Dashboard in Account Settings and click "Request Data Export." You'll receive a download link within 48 hours containing your account information, purchase history, uploaded content, and activity logs in machine-readable JSON format. Data exports are available for download for 14 days before automatic deletion.

# Billing and Payment Frequently Asked Questions

## Understanding Your Invoice

**Q: How do I access my invoice?**

You can view and download your invoice from your account dashboard. Navigate to Billing > Invoices to see all past statements. Invoices are generated automatically on your billing cycle date and sent via email.

**Q: What payment methods do you accept?**

We accept all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover), debit cards, PayPal, and bank transfers for enterprise accounts. Digital wallet payments (Apple Pay, Google Pay) are also supported through our mobile app.

## Charges and Fees

**Q: Why was I charged twice?**

Double charges typically occur when a payment fails initially and is retried. If you see duplicate charges, please contact our billing department immediately. We'll investigate and issue a refund within 3-5 business days if the charge was erroneous.

**Q: Can I get a refund for unused service?**

Yes, we offer prorated refunds for annual subscriptions canceled before renewal. Monthly subscriptions are not eligible for partial refunds, but you'll retain access until the end of your billing period. See our refund policy for complete details.

**Q: What are these additional fees on my bill?**

Additional fees may include:
- Late payment penalties (applied after 15 days past due)
- Service restoration fees (if account was suspended)
- Premium support surcharges
- International transaction fees
- Tax adjustments based on your location

## Billing Disputes and Corrections

**Q: I don't recognize a charge. What should I do?**

First, check if the charge description matches our company name or our payment processor. Sometimes charges appear under different names. If you still don't recognize it, contact our fraud prevention team within 60 days to dispute the transaction.

**Q: How do I update my billing information?**

To update your payment method, credit card details, or billing address:
1. Log into your account
2. Go to Settings > Payment Methods
3. Click "Add New Payment Method" or edit existing ones
4. Save changes and set a default payment method

Changes take effect immediately for future charges.

## Subscription Management

**Q: How do I cancel my subscription?**

You can cancel anytime from your account settings. Go to Subscriptions > Manage Plan > Cancel Subscription. You'll be asked to confirm and provide optional feedback. Your access continues until the end of your current billing period.

**Q: Will I be charged after canceling?**

No automatic charges will occur after cancellation. However, any outstanding balance must be paid. If you cancel during a free trial, you won't be charged at all.

**Q: Can I pause my subscription instead of canceling?**

Enterprise and professional plans can be paused for up to 90 days per year. During the pause, you won't be billed, but you also won't have access to services. Contact your account manager to arrange a subscription pause.

## Technical Billing Issues

**Q: My payment failed. What now?**

Payment failures happen for several reasons:
- Insufficient funds
- Expired credit card
- Bank security blocks
- Incorrect billing information

Update your payment method and retry. If problems persist after 3 attempts, contact your bank. We'll hold your account for 7 days before suspension.

**Q: How do I request a receipt or statement?**

All receipts are automatically emailed after successful payment. You can also download them from Billing > Receipts. For tax purposes, we can provide annual statements or custom date-range reports upon request.

## Enterprise and Volume Billing

**Q: Do you offer volume discounts?**

Yes, enterprise customers with 50+ users qualify for volume pricing. Contact our sales team for custom quotes. Educational institutions and non-profits may also qualify for special discounted rates.

**Q: Can I pay annually instead of monthly?**

Absolutely. Annual billing provides a 15% discount compared to monthly plans. You can switch to annual billing at any time, and we'll credit any remaining monthly subscription balance toward your annual payment.

**Q: We need separate invoices for different departments. Is this possible?**

Enterprise accounts can split billing across cost centers or departments. Contact your account manager to set up multi-entity billing with separate invoices, payment methods, and usage tracking.

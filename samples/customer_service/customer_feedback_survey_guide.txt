Customer Feedback and Survey Guide

Post-Purchase Satisfaction Survey

Survey Timing: Send 7-10 days after delivery confirmation to allow sufficient product experience time. Earlier surveys capture initial impressions but miss usage-related issues. Later surveys risk lower response rates due to fading memory of purchase experience.

Core Questions:

1. Overall Satisfaction (1-5 scale)
"How satisfied are you with your recent purchase from [Company Name]?"
1 = Very Dissatisfied, 2 = Dissatisfied, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Satisfied, 5 = Very Satisfied

2. Product Quality (1-5 scale)
"How would you rate the quality of the product you received?"
Follow-up for ratings 1-3: "What specific aspects fell short of your expectations?"

3. Value Assessment (1-5 scale)
"How would you rate the value for money of your purchase?"
This measures price-to-quality perception and pricing strategy effectiveness.

4. Delivery Experience (1-5 scale)
"How satisfied were you with the delivery speed and packaging quality?"
Follow-up: "Did your order arrive on time and undamaged?"

5. Product Expectations (1-5 scale)
"How well did the product match the description and images on our website?"
Lower scores indicate listing accuracy issues requiring attention.

6. Likelihood to Recommend (0-10 scale - Net Promoter Score)
"How likely are you to recommend [Company Name] to friends or colleagues?"
0 = Not at all likely, 10 = Extremely likely
NPS calculation: % Promoters (9-10) minus % Detractors (0-6)

7. Open Feedback (Text field)
"Is there anything else you'd like to share about your experience?"
Optional field captures unanticipated insights beyond structured questions.

Target response rate: 15-25% for email surveys. Incentivize with discount codes for completion to boost participation. Keep total survey time under 2 minutes to minimize abandonment.

Customer Support Interaction Survey

Survey Timing: Send immediately after ticket closure while interaction memory is fresh. Same-day response rates are 3x higher than delayed surveys.

Core Questions:

1. Issue Resolution (Yes/No)
"Was your issue completely resolved?"
If No: "What remains unresolved?" (Text field for follow-up action)

2. Resolution Time Satisfaction (1-5 scale)
"How satisfied were you with the time it took to resolve your issue?"
Measures whether SLA compliance meets customer expectations.

3. Agent Knowledge (1-5 scale)

Target response rate: 25-35% for post-support surveys. Higher engagement due to recent interaction and investment in resolution.

Feature Request and Product Improvement Survey

Survey Timing: Quarterly to active users, or triggered when customers use advanced features indicating higher engagement levels.

Core Questions:

1. Feature Usage Assessment
"Which features do you use regularly?" (Multi-select checklist)
Identifies popular features and underutilized functionality needing improvement or deprecation.

2. Pain Points Identification (Text field)
"What tasks or workflows are most frustrating or time-consuming in our product?"
Uncovers improvement opportunities from user perspective.

3. Missing Functionality (Text field)
"What features or capabilities do you wish our product had?"
Direct feature request gathering for product roadmap prioritization.

4. Competitive Comparison
"What features in competing products do you find valuable that we don't offer?"

Website User Experience Survey

Survey Format: Non-intrusive pop-up or slide-in after user completes action (purchase, account creation, etc.) or spends 60+ seconds on specific pages. Limit frequency to once per user per 30 days to avoid annoyance.

Core Questions:

1. Task Completion Success

"How easy was it to find what you were looking for?"
Identifies navigation, search, and information architecture issues.

3. Page Load Performance
"How satisfied were you with page loading speed?"
Correlate with actual performance metrics to identify perception versus reality gaps.

4. Mobile Experience (if applicable)
"How would you rate your mobile browsing experience?"
Mobile-specific pain points often differ from desktop issues.

Open text field for win-back opportunities.

3. Alternative Solution
"What product or service are you switching to, if any?"
Competitive intelligence on churn destinations.

4. Price Sensitivity
"Would you reconsider if we offered [X% discount/different pricing tier]?"
Tests price elasticity and retention offer effectiveness.

5. Feature Gaps
"What missing features led to your decision to cancel?"
Product development priorities for retention.

6. Overall Experience Rating (1-5 scale)
"Overall, how would you rate your experience as our customer?"
Tracks whether churn is due to dissatisfaction or changing needs.

7. Willingness to Return
"Would you consider using our service again in the future?"
Identifies churned customers worth re-engagement campaigns.

Response rate: 20-30% for cancellation surveys due to high engagement during decision moment. Offer incentive to complete survey and reconsider (limited-time retention discount).

Survey Best Practices

Keep surveys short: 5-7 questions maximum taking under 3 minutes. Higher question counts exponentially increase abandonment rates. Use branching logic to show follow-up questions only when relevant based on previous answers.

Mix question types: Combine quantitative scales (for metrics tracking) with qualitative open text (for insight depth). Ratio of 60% quantitative, 40% qualitative balances analysis with nuance.

Avoid leading questions: "How much do you love our product?" biases responses. Use neutral phrasing: "How do you feel about our product?"

Provide context: Explain how feedback will be used. "Your responses help us improve our service" increases completion rates by 15-20%.

Make surveys mobile-friendly: 40-60% of responses come from mobile devices. Test survey rendering on various screen sizes. Use large tap targets and minimal typing requirements.

Time distribution appropriately: Send surveys during business hours Tuesday-Thursday for highest response rates. Avoid Mondays (email overload) and Fridays (weekend mindset).

Close the feedback loop: Email respondents thanking them and summarizing how their feedback is being used. Share when suggested improvements are implemented to encourage future participation.

Segment analysis: Analyze responses by customer segments (new vs. returning, account tier, product usage patterns) to identify segment-specific issues and opportunities.

Track trends over time: Monitor metric changes month-over-month and year-over-year. Identify seasonal patterns and measure impact of improvement initiatives.

Act on feedback: Surveys without action damage credibility and reduce future response rates. Prioritize high-impact issues mentioned frequently in feedback for addressing first.

Response Analysis Framework

Quantitative Metrics:
- Calculate average scores for scale questions by segment
- Track response distribution (% selecting each option)
- Monitor trends over time periods
- Set target thresholds (e.g., 4.0+ average satisfaction score)
- Alert on significant drops month-over-month

Qualitative Analysis:
- Categorize open text responses into themes
- Count frequency of each theme mention
- Identify emerging patterns not captured by structured questions
- Extract specific customer quotes for sharing with teams
- Prioritize issues by severity and frequency

Sentiment Analysis:
- Classify text responses as positive, neutral, negative
- Cross-reference sentiment with quantitative scores
- Identify disconnects between numerical ratings and written feedback

Response Prioritization:
- High impact + high frequency = immediate action required
- High impact + low frequency = monitor for trend emergence
- Low impact + high frequency = process improvement opportunity
- Low impact + low frequency = log for potential future consideration

Reporting Cadence:
- Daily: Critical support satisfaction scores for immediate intervention
- Weekly: Support interaction metrics for agent coaching
- Monthly: Overall satisfaction trends for management review
- Quarterly: Comprehensive analysis for strategic planning

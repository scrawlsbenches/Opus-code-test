Return and Refund Policy

Return Eligibility and Time Limits

Physical products may be returned within 30 days of delivery for a full refund if unused, undamaged, and in original packaging with all accessories and documentation. The 30-day window begins on the delivery date shown in your shipping confirmation, not the order date. Items purchased during promotional periods follow the same return policy unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Certain product categories have modified return periods or restrictions. Software licenses and digital downloads are non-returnable once activation codes are revealed or downloads initiated. Opened hygiene products, personalized items, and clearance merchandise marked "final sale" cannot be returned for safety or business reasons. Gift cards and subscription services are non-refundable except where required by law.

To initiate a return, log into your account and select the order from your purchase history. Click "Return Items" and follow the return authorization process. You'll receive a return merchandise authorization (RMA) number and prepaid shipping label via email within 24 hours. Include the RMA number on the outside of the return package.

Condition Requirements for Refunds

Returned items must be in resalable condition to qualify for full refund. Products showing signs of use, damage, missing components, or removed serial numbers may be subject to partial refunds or rejected returns. We inspect all returns upon receipt before processing refunds. Restocking fees of 15-25% may apply to items returned in non-original condition.

Original packaging must be intact and unmarked. Do not write or place stickers directly on manufacturer packaging - use an outer shipping box. Include all manuals, cables, accessories, warranty cards, and bonus items that came with the product. Missing accessories reduce refund amounts proportionally to their value.

Electronic devices must be factory reset before return to remove personal data. We're not responsible for personal information left on returned devices. Failure to wipe devices may delay refund processing while we perform data erasure for your protection. Consult device manuals for factory reset procedures.

Refund Processing Timeline

Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days after we receive and inspect your return. You'll receive email confirmation when your return is received and again when the refund is approved. Actual credit to your account depends on your financial institution and typically takes an additional 3-5 business days for credit cards or 5-10 business days for bank transfers.

Original shipping charges are non-refundable unless the return is due to our error such as wrong item shipped or defective product. Return shipping costs are your responsibility for buyer's remorse returns. Use the prepaid label we provide or choose your own carrier - you're responsible for return shipping costs regardless of method chosen.

Refunds are issued to the original payment method used for purchase. Credit card refunds return to the same card number. PayPal purchases receive PayPal refunds. Purchases made with multiple payment methods are refunded proportionally to each method. Gift card purchases receive account credit or replacement gift cards rather than cash refunds.

Defective or Damaged Products

Report defective items or shipping damage within 48 hours of delivery for fastest resolution. Take photos of all damage including outer packaging, inner packaging, and the product itself. Submit photos through our returns portal along with your order number. We may file shipping insurance claims requiring this documentation.

Defective products receive free return shipping and full refunds including original shipping costs. We'll email a prepaid return label immediately upon defect verification. Alternatively, request an exchange for the same product. Exchanges ship as soon as we receive the defective item, or we can ship the replacement immediately and charge your card if the defective item isn't returned within 14 days.

Manufacturing defects discovered within the manufacturer's warranty period should be processed directly with the manufacturer for potentially faster resolution. We facilitate warranty service for items purchased from us. Warranty service often provides repairs or replacements without requiring product returns to us. Contact our support team for warranty claim assistance.

Wrong Item Received

We occasionally ship incorrect items due to warehouse picking errors. Contact customer service immediately upon receiving wrong items. We'll arrange free return pickup and expedite shipment of correct items. Priority processing ensures correct items ship within 24 hours, usually before the wrong item is even picked up.

Do not refuse delivery or return items to carrier without authorization. Carrier-refused packages experience significant processing delays. Accept delivery, then contact us for return authorization. We track all shipments and proactively reach out if tracking indicates delivery issues, but customer notification speeds resolution.

Keep wrong items in original unopened condition when possible. Opened wrong items are still eligible for free return and exchange, but unopened items can be processed faster. You're not responsible for costs associated with our shipping errors including return shipping, restocking, or original shipping charges.

Digital Products and Subscriptions

Digital software licenses, downloadable content, and online courses are non-refundable once access is granted or activation codes revealed. We cannot revoke licenses or verify deletion of downloaded content, making refunds impractical. Review product descriptions, system requirements, and trial versions before purchasing.

Subscription services can be cancelled at any time, but refunds for partial billing periods are not provided except where legally required. Service access continues through the end of the paid period after cancellation. Auto-renewal can be disabled in account settings to prevent future charges while maintaining current access.

Technical issues preventing access to digital purchases may qualify for refunds at our discretion. Contact technical support first to resolve access problems. If technical support cannot restore access within 48 hours, refund requests will be evaluated case-by-case based on the specific circumstances.

Exchanges and Store Credit

Product exchanges for different items require processing the return for refund and placing a new order. We cannot guarantee inventory availability for exchanges. To secure replacement items before returning originals, place a new order and process the original as a separate return. Some customers prefer store credit rather than waiting for refunds to original payment methods.

Store credit issued for returns can be used for future purchases without expiration. Credits are applied to your account and automatically appear as payment options during checkout. Store credit cannot be transferred between accounts, redeemed for cash, or used to purchase gift cards.

Damaged, defective, or wrong items receive free exchanges with prepaid return shipping. Preference changes or buyer's remorse exchanges require return shipping payment. Consider size or compatibility issues carefully before ordering to minimize exchange needs. Detailed product descriptions, specifications, and customer reviews help prevent ordering wrong items.

International Returns

International return shipping costs can be substantial. Contact customer support before initiating international returns to discuss options. In some cases, partial refunds accounting for return shipping costs may be more economical than physical returns. Each situation is evaluated individually to find fair resolution.

International customers are responsible for any customs duties, taxes, or fees incurred during returns. These charges are not refundable as they were paid to government agencies rather than to us. Declare returned merchandise accurately on customs forms to minimize return-related customs charges.

International return processing takes longer due to shipping times and customs clearance. Allow 3-4 weeks for international returns to reach our warehouse. Refunds process within 5-7 business days after receipt. Use tracked shipping methods for international returns to monitor delivery progress and provide proof of return if needed.

Restocking Fees

Non-defective returns of opened electronics, large appliances, and special order items incur 15% restocking fees to offset depreciation and re-certification costs. Restocking fees are deducted from refund amounts. The fee covers inspection, cleaning, repackaging, and return to inventory. Items showing any use or cosmetic imperfection may incur higher restocking fees up to 25%.

No restocking fees apply to defective items, wrong items shipped, or items returned unopened in original condition. Restocking fees are clearly indicated during the return authorization process before you commit to the return. If the fee seems excessive, contact customer service to discuss the assessment.

Refused or Abandoned Returns

Returns must be shipped within 14 days of receiving the RMA number. RMA numbers expire after 14 days, requiring new authorization for subsequent return attempts. Expired RMA returns may be refused by our warehouse or treated as unauthorized returns subject to receiving fees before processing.

Packages sent to us without return authorization are held for 30 days awaiting customer contact. Unauthorized returns cannot be matched to orders or customers without RMA numbers. Contact customer service if you shipped a return without authorization. After 30 days without contact, unauthorized returns are disposed of or donated without refund.

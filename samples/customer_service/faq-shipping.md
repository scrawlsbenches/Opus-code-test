# Shipping and Delivery Frequently Asked Questions

## Shipping Options and Timeframes

**Q: What shipping methods are available?**

We offer multiple shipping options to meet your needs:
- **Standard Shipping**: 5-7 business days (free on orders over $50)
- **Express Shipping**: 2-3 business days ($12.99)
- **Overnight Delivery**: Next business day by 5pm ($24.99)
- **International Shipping**: 7-21 days depending on destination

Expedited options must be selected before 2pm EST for same-day processing.

**Q: How can I track my package?**

Once your order ships, you'll receive a tracking number via email. Click the tracking link or enter the number on our website's Order Status page. Tracking updates every 4-6 hours. For real-time updates, use the carrier's tracking portal directly.

**Q: Can I change my shipping address after ordering?**

If your order hasn't shipped yet, contact us immediately to modify the address. Once the package is in transit, you'll need to work directly with the carrier to redirect delivery. Some carriers charge fees for address changes during transit.

## Delivery Problems

**Q: My package shows delivered, but I didn't receive it**

First, check:
- All entrances to your home (front/back door, garage)
- With neighbors who may have accepted delivery
- Inside your mailbox or parcel locker
- Building reception desk or concierge

If you still can't locate it after 24 hours, file a missing package claim. We'll investigate with the carrier and either replace your order or issue a refund.

**Q: My delivery is delayed. What can I do?**

Delays happen due to weather, carrier capacity, or customs (for international orders). Check the tracking for updates. If your package is more than 3 days past the estimated delivery date, contact us for assistance. We can expedite a replacement or offer a shipping refund.

**Q: The package arrived damaged**

We apologize for damaged deliveries. Please:
1. Take photos of the package exterior and damaged contents
2. Keep all packaging materials
3. Contact us within 48 hours with photos and order number
4. We'll arrange replacement or refund immediately

Damaged items don't need to be returned unless specifically requested.

## International Shipping

**Q: Do you ship internationally?**

Yes, we ship to over 150 countries. International shipping rates vary by destination and package weight. Customers are responsible for any customs duties, import taxes, or brokerage fees imposed by their country.

**Q: Why is my international package held in customs?**

Customs holds packages for inspection or when documentation is incomplete. You may need to:
- Provide additional identification
- Pay import duties or taxes
- Clarify the contents or value

Contact your local customs office with the tracking number for specific requirements. We can provide commercial invoices or declarations if needed.

**Q: How are international shipping costs calculated?**

International rates depend on:
- Package weight and dimensions
- Destination country
- Shipping speed selected
- Declared value for insurance

Use our shipping calculator at checkout for exact costs. Some countries have restrictions on certain products.

## Returns and Exchanges Shipping

**Q: Who pays for return shipping?**

For defective or incorrect items, we provide a prepaid return label at no cost. For other returns (change of mind, wrong size), customers pay return shipping unless you have a premium membership, which includes free return shipping.

**Q: How do I return an item?**

1. Initiate a return request in your account
2. Print the return label (or request one via email)
3. Package the item securely in original packaging if possible
4. Drop off at any carrier location or schedule pickup
5. Track your return using the provided tracking number

Refunds are processed within 5 business days of receiving the return.

**Q: Can I exchange an item instead of returning it?**

Yes, exchanges are processed as a return plus a new order. Return the original item using our return process, and place a new order for the replacement. This ensures you get the new item faster than waiting for the return to process first.

## Shipping Costs and Fees

**Q: Why is my shipping cost so high?**

Shipping costs reflect:
- Package weight and size (oversized items cost more)
- Distance from our warehouse
- Selected shipping speed
- Special handling requirements (fragile, refrigerated, etc.)

Consider standard shipping for lower costs, or add items to qualify for free shipping threshold.

**Q: Can I combine multiple orders to save on shipping?**

If you placed multiple orders on the same day and they haven't shipped yet, contact us to combine them. Once orders enter fulfillment, they can't be merged. Consider using our shopping cart's "Save for Later" feature to accumulate items before checkout.

**Q: Do you offer free shipping?**

Yes, we offer free standard shipping on:
- Orders over $50 within the continental US
- All orders for premium members
- Promotional periods (check our website for current offers)

Free shipping doesn't apply to expedited delivery, Alaska, Hawaii, or international orders.

## Special Circumstances

**Q: I need delivery by a specific date. Can you guarantee it?**

While we can't guarantee specific delivery dates due to carrier variables, express and overnight shipping have high on-time rates (95%+). Order well in advance for critical dates. For large or custom orders, contact our concierge team for special delivery arrangements.

**Q: Can someone else receive my package?**

Yes, packages can be delivered to anyone at the shipping address. For high-value items, signature confirmation may be required. You can add delivery instructions like "Leave with neighbor" or request hold at carrier facility for pickup.

**Q: What if I'm not home during delivery?**

Most carriers leave packages in a safe location if signature isn't required. You can:
- Provide delivery instructions in your account settings
- Authorize release without signature (carrier-dependent)
- Request hold for pickup at a carrier facility
- Use carrier's app to select alternative delivery dates

Check your tracking information for carrier-specific options.

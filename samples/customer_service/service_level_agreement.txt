Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Customer Support

Response Time Commitments

Our customer support team is committed to providing timely responses based on issue priority and customer tier. Response times are measured from initial ticket submission to first agent response during business hours. Business hours are Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM EST, excluding federal holidays.

Critical Priority Issues (System Down, Security Breach, Payment Failures)
- Enterprise Customers: 1 hour response time, 24/7 availability
- Professional Customers: 2 hour response time during business hours
- Standard Customers: 4 hour response time during business hours

High Priority Issues (Major Feature Unavailable, Recurring Problems, Billing Disputes)
- Enterprise Customers: 4 hour response time, 24/7 availability
- Professional Customers: 8 hour response time during business hours
- Standard Customers: 12 hour response time during business hours

Medium Priority Issues (Minor Feature Issues, General Questions, How-To Requests)
- Enterprise Customers: 8 hour response time
- Professional Customers: 24 hour response time
- Standard Customers: 48 hour response time

Low Priority Issues (Feature Requests, General Feedback, Documentation Questions)
- Enterprise Customers: 24 hour response time
- Professional Customers: 48 hour response time
- Standard Customers: 72 hour response time

Priority classification is determined by business impact, number of affected users, and availability of workarounds. Customers cannot manually set priority levels; our triage team assigns priority based on issue description and account tier.

Resolution Time Objectives

Resolution time measures from initial ticket submission to complete issue resolution and customer confirmation. These are target objectives, not guarantees, as resolution complexity varies significantly between issues.

Critical Priority: 4-8 hours for Enterprise, 8-24 hours for Professional, 24-48 hours for Standard
High Priority: 24-48 hours for Enterprise, 48-72 hours for Professional, 3-5 business days for Standard
Medium Priority: 2-5 business days for Enterprise, 5-7 business days for Professional, 7-10 business days for Standard
Low Priority: 5-10 business days for Enterprise, 10-14 business days for Professional, 14-21 business days for Standard

Complex issues requiring engineering involvement, third-party coordination, or extensive investigation may exceed these objectives. Customers receive regular status updates every 24-48 hours for ongoing issues until resolution.

Support Channels and Availability

Email Support: Available 24/7 for all customer tiers. Emails sent outside business hours receive responses when support operations resume. Enterprise customers receive priority queue placement ensuring faster response times.

Live Chat Support: Available during business hours (8 AM - 8 PM EST, Monday-Friday) for Professional and Enterprise customers. Standard customers have access to AI-powered chat assistance 24/7 with agent escalation during business hours.

Phone Support: Available 9 AM - 6 PM EST, Monday-Friday for Professional and Enterprise customers. Enterprise customers have access to dedicated support phone lines with extended hours and escalation paths.

Customer Portal: Self-service portal available 24/7 for all customers providing knowledge base access, ticket submission, status tracking, and account management. Portal uptime guarantee of 99.9% with scheduled maintenance announced 7 days in advance.

Escalation Procedures

First Level Support: All tickets begin with our front-line support team handling common issues, account questions, and basic troubleshooting. 80% of issues are resolved at this level without escalation.

Second Level Support: Complex technical issues, bugs, or unresolved first-level tickets escalate to specialized technical support teams. Escalation occurs automatically after 3 business days without resolution or immediately for critical issues.

Third Level Support: Engineering team involvement for software defects, architectural issues, or system-level problems requiring code changes or infrastructure modifications. Engineering escalations follow formal bug tracking and release cycle processes.

Management Escalation: Unresolved issues after 7 business days or customer dissatisfaction with support quality can be escalated to support management. Enterprise customers have direct access to dedicated account managers for escalation coordination.

Executive Escalation: Prolonged unresolved issues, major business impact, or failed management escalations can be escalated to executive support leadership. Executive escalations trigger executive review meetings and dedicated resolution task forces.

Customers can request escalation at any time if they feel their issue requires higher-level attention. Escalation requests are reviewed within 24 hours and approved based on issue severity and resolution progress.

Performance Metrics and Reporting

First Contact Resolution: Percentage of issues resolved during initial support interaction without follow-up required. Current performance: 73% across all tiers.

Ticket Reopening Rate: Percentage of resolved tickets reopened due to incomplete resolution or recurring issues. Target: Below 8%. Current performance: 6.2%.

Monthly SLA reports are provided to Enterprise customers showing performance against commitments, ticket volume trends, and common issue categories. Professional customers receive quarterly reports upon request.

Exclusions and Limitations

SLA commitments do not apply to: issues caused by customer misuse or unauthorized modifications, third-party service outages beyond our control, scheduled maintenance windows announced 7+ days in advance, force majeure events (natural disasters, pandemics, civil unrest), internet connectivity issues on customer side, or unsupported configurations not covered in documentation.

Response and resolution times may be extended during peak support periods, major version releases, or widespread service disruptions affecting multiple customers. Customers receive notification when SLA extensions are in effect.

Support is provided in English only. Customers requiring support in other languages may experience delays while translation resources are arranged. Technical support covers current software versions and one prior major version. Legacy versions are not supported under standard SLA.

SLA Credits and Remediation

Enterprise customers receive SLA credits for failures to meet committed response times:
- Missing Critical response time: 10% monthly service credit
- Missing High response time 3+ times per month: 5% monthly service credit
- Missing Medium response time 5+ times per month: 3% monthly service credit

SLA credits are applied automatically to next month's invoice and do not require customer request. Credits are capped at 25% of monthly service fees per month regardless of multiple SLA failures.

Professional customers do not receive automatic SLA credits but may request service credits for significant support failures through account review process.

Standard customers are not eligible for SLA credits but receive best-effort support with continuous improvement focus.

Knowledge Base and Self-Service

Comprehensive knowledge base contains 500+ articles covering common issues, how-to guides, troubleshooting procedures, and best practices. Knowledge base is searchable and organized by topic, updated weekly based on support ticket trends.

Video tutorials demonstrate complex procedures and feature usage. Tutorial library contains 50+ videos ranging from 2-15 minutes in length covering beginner through advanced topics.

Community forums enable peer-to-peer support and knowledge sharing. Forums are moderated by support staff who verify technical accuracy of community-provided solutions. Top community contributors receive recognition and early access to new features.

Self-service resources enable customers to resolve many issues independently outside support hours. Knowledge base analytics show 40% of support tickets include knowledge base article references in resolution.

Continuous Improvement Commitment

Quarterly service reviews analyze support metrics, customer feedback, and emerging trends to identify improvement opportunities. New knowledge base articles, process refinements, and agent training programs address identified gaps.

Customer feedback surveys follow every support interaction requesting ratings and comments. Feedback directly influences agent performance evaluations, training priorities, and process improvements.

Root cause analysis for recurring issues identifies systematic problems requiring product changes, documentation improvements, or process modifications. Engineering receives prioritized enhancement requests based on support impact analysis.

Annual SLA reviews evaluate performance against commitments and adjust objectives based on business growth, technology changes, and customer expectations. SLA modifications require 90-day advance notice to customers.

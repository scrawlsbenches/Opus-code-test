Perfumery blends aromatic compounds into harmonious compositions structured
around volatility-based pyramid architecture. Top notes—citrus bergamot,
sparkling aldehydes, green galbanum—create initial impressions evaporating
within minutes. Heart notes—floral jasmine, spicy cardamom, rose absolute—emerge
as primary character during hours of wear.

Base notes anchor compositions with persistent materials: earthy vetiver,
animalic musk, resinous benzoin, and precious oud persist for days on skin.
Synthetic molecules expand palettes beyond natural limitations—Iso E Super
imparts velvety woodiness, Ambroxan delivers ambery warmth, Hedione adds
transparent jasmine radiance. Accords combine multiple materials into unified
olfactory impressions greater than individual components.

Natural extraction methods yield absolutes through solvent extraction,
essential oils through steam distillation, and concretes through enfleurage.
Headspace technology captures volatile profiles from living flowers.
Perfumers train noses distinguishing thousands of raw materials, developing
signature styles across chypre, fougere, oriental, and floral families.
IFRA regulations restrict allergens and sensitizers, constantly reshaping
permissible formulations while perfumers reformulate classics to maintain
compliance.

Algorithmic Trading Systems

Algorithmic trading executes orders using automated pre-programmed instructions accounting for variables like timing, price, and volume. High-frequency trading systems process market data through low-latency pipelines, making microsecond decisions on order placement. Mean reversion strategies identify price deviations from historical averages, betting on eventual return to equilibrium.

Order matching engines form the exchange backbone, maintaining order books with bid-ask spreads. FIFO queues prioritize earlier orders at each price level. Market makers provide liquidity by continuously posting both buy and sell orders, profiting from the spread while accepting inventory risk.

Risk management modules calculate position exposure, value-at-risk metrics, and drawdown limits in real-time. Circuit breakers halt trading when volatility exceeds thresholds. Backtesting frameworks replay historical tick data to validate strategies before deployment.

Technical indicators like moving averages, Bollinger bands, and RSI generate trading signals. Pattern recognition algorithms identify chart formations—head-and-shoulders, double bottoms, support-resistance levels. Machine learning models increasingly replace hand-crafted rules, training on features extracted from price, volume, and order flow data.

Execution algorithms minimize market impact through strategies like TWAP (time-weighted average price) and VWAP (volume-weighted average price). Smart order routing fragments large orders across multiple venues seeking best execution. Slippage monitoring tracks deviation between expected and realized prices.

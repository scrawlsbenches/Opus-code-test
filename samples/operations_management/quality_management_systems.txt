# Quality Management Systems: Principles and Implementation

## Introduction

A Quality Management System (QMS) is a formalized system documenting processes, procedures, and responsibilities for achieving quality policies and objectives. Effective QMS ensures consistent products and services, customer satisfaction, and continuous improvement.

## Quality Management Principles (ISO 9001)

### 1. Customer Focus

**Objective:** Meet customer requirements and exceed expectations

**Actions:**
- Understand current and future customer needs
- Link organizational objectives to customer needs
- Measure and monitor customer satisfaction
- Manage customer relationships systematically

### 2. Leadership

**Objective:** Create unity of purpose and direction

**Actions:**
- Establish quality policy and objectives
- Ensure integration of QMS into business processes
- Promote process approach and risk-based thinking
- Recognize employee contributions

### 3. Engagement of People

**Objective:** Competent, empowered people at all levels

**Actions:**
- Communicate importance of individual contribution
- Enable people to identify constraints
- Recognize and acknowledge contribution
- Enable self-evaluation against objectives

### 4. Process Approach

**Objective:** Manage activities as interrelated processes

**Actions:**
- Define objectives and processes to achieve them
- Establish authority and responsibility
- Understand and manage interrelationships
- Make decisions based on data analysis

### 5. Improvement

**Objective:** Ongoing focus on improvement

**Actions:**
- Promote improvement objectives at all levels
- Train people in improvement methods
- Track and review improvement projects
- Recognize improvement success

### 6. Evidence-Based Decision Making

**Objective:** Decisions based on data analysis

**Actions:**
- Determine, measure, and monitor key indicators
- Make data available to relevant people
- Use appropriate methods for analysis
- Balance evidence with experience and intuition

### 7. Relationship Management

**Objective:** Manage relationships with interested parties

**Actions:**
- Identify relevant interested parties
- Prioritize relationships to manage
- Establish mutually beneficial relationships
- Pool resources and share information

## ISO 9001:2015 Requirements

### Context of Organization

- Understand internal and external issues
- Identify interested parties and their requirements
- Determine QMS scope
- Establish QMS processes

### Leadership

- Demonstrate leadership and commitment
- Establish quality policy
- Assign roles, responsibilities, and authorities
- Address risks and opportunities

### Planning

- Actions to address risks and opportunities
- Quality objectives and planning
- Planning of changes

### Support

- Resources (people, infrastructure, environment, monitoring/measuring, knowledge)
- Competence
- Awareness
- Communication
- Documented information

### Operation

- Operational planning and control
- Requirements for products and services
- Design and development
- Control of external provision
- Production and service provision
- Release and control of nonconforming outputs

### Performance Evaluation

- Monitoring, measurement, analysis, evaluation
- Internal audit
- Management review

### Improvement

- Nonconformity and corrective action
- Continual improvement

## Quality Tools and Techniques

### Seven Basic Quality Tools

**1. Check Sheet:**
Structured form for collecting data

**2. Histogram:**
Bar chart showing frequency distribution

**3. Pareto Chart:**
Bar chart ordered by frequency (80/20 rule)

**4. Cause-and-Effect Diagram (Fishbone):**
Identify root causes by category (Man, Machine, Method, Material, Measurement, Environment)

**5. Scatter Diagram:**
Plot relationship between two variables

**6. Control Chart:**
Track process over time, identify special cause variation

**7. Flowchart:**
Visual representation of process steps

### Statistical Process Control (SPC)

**Control Charts:**
- X-bar and R chart: Mean and range of samples
- p-chart: Proportion defective
- c-chart: Count of defects

**Control Limits:**
UCL = X̄ + 3σ
LCL = X̄ - 3σ

**Interpretation Rules:**
- Point outside control limits
- Run of 7+ points above/below center
- Trends of 7+ consecutive increasing/decreasing points
- Patterns suggesting non-random behavior

### Process Capability

**Capability Indices:**

Cp = (USL - LSL) / (6σ)  [Process potential]

Cpk = min[(USL - μ) / (3σ), (μ - LSL) / (3σ)]  [Process capability]

**Targets:**
- Cp ≥ 1.33: Capable process
- Cpk ≥ 1.33: Capable and centered

### Six Sigma

**DMAIC Methodology:**
- **Define:** Project scope, goals, customer requirements
- **Measure:** Current performance, data collection
- **Analyze:** Root cause analysis
- **Improve:** Solution implementation
- **Control:** Sustain improvements

**Sigma Levels:**
| Sigma | DPMO | Yield |
|-------|------|-------|
| 2σ | 308,537 | 69.1% |
| 3σ | 66,807 | 93.3% |
| 4σ | 6,210 | 99.38% |
| 5σ | 233 | 99.977% |
| 6σ | 3.4 | 99.9997% |

## Quality Costs

### Prevention Costs
- Quality planning
- Training
- Process control
- Supplier evaluation

### Appraisal Costs
- Inspection and testing
- Audit
- Calibration
- Laboratory testing

### Internal Failure Costs
- Scrap and rework
- Reinspection
- Downtime
- Failure analysis

### External Failure Costs
- Warranty claims
- Returns and complaints
- Recalls
- Liability

**Cost of Quality:**
Typically 15-25% of revenue; world-class organizations <5%

## Auditing

### Types of Audits

**First-Party (Internal):**
Organization audits itself

**Second-Party:**
Customer audits supplier

**Third-Party:**
Independent certification body

### Audit Process

1. **Planning:** Scope, criteria, schedule
2. **Preparation:** Document review, checklist
3. **Opening Meeting:** Confirm scope, logistics
4. **Evidence Gathering:** Interviews, observation, document review
5. **Analysis:** Compare evidence to criteria
6. **Reporting:** Findings, nonconformities
7. **Closing Meeting:** Present results
8. **Follow-up:** Verify corrective actions

### Writing Nonconformities

**Structure:**
- Requirement violated (reference standard clause)
- Objective evidence observed
- Classification (major, minor, observation)

**Example:**
"Requirement: ISO 9001:2015 clause 7.5.3.2(a) requires documented information to be available where needed. Evidence: The work instruction for assembly (WI-123) was not available at the workstation during the audit on 15 Dec."

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Planning
- Obtain management commitment
- Appoint management representative
- Conduct gap assessment
- Develop implementation plan

### Phase 2: Documentation
- Write quality manual (optional in 2015)
- Develop procedures for key processes
- Create work instructions as needed
- Establish forms and records

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Train all personnel
- Implement processes and procedures
- Begin collecting records
- Establish monitoring and measurement

### Phase 4: Verification
- Conduct internal audits
- Perform management review
- Take corrective actions
- Verify effectiveness

### Phase 5: Certification
- Select certification body
- Stage 1 audit (documentation review)
- Stage 2 audit (implementation verification)
- Address nonconformities
- Achieve certification

Wine Tasting Vocabulary and Sensory Analysis

Wine tasting employs systematic sensory evaluation to assess quality and character. Professional tasters develop precise vocabulary describing visual appearance, aromatic profiles, taste sensations, and structural elements. This specialized language enables consistent communication about subjective sensory experiences.

Visual assessment examines color intensity and hue. White wines range from pale straw through golden to amber with age. Red wines progress from purple through ruby to garnet and brick with maturation. Clarity indicates filtration and potential faults. Viscosity appears as tears or legs forming on glass surfaces.

Aromatic evaluation distinguishes primary, secondary, and tertiary aromas. Primary aromas derive from grape varieties including floral, fruit, and herbal notes. Secondary aromas arise from fermentation producing yeast and malolactic characters. Tertiary aromas develop through aging, contributing oak influence, oxidative notes, and bottle bouquet.

Fruit descriptors span the spectrum from citrus through tropical, stone fruit, red fruit, black fruit, and dried fruit. Citrus notes include lemon, lime, grapefruit, and orange peel. Tropical fruits encompass mango, pineapple, passion fruit, and banana. Stone fruits reference peach, apricot, nectarine, and plum.

Structural elements define wine architecture. Acidity provides freshness and backbone, ranging from flabby through balanced to tart. Tannins contribute astringency and texture in red wines, described from silky through firm to grippy. Alcohol manifests as warmth and body. Sweetness indicates residual sugar levels.

Balance describes harmony among structural components. Well-balanced wines integrate acidity, tannin, alcohol, and fruit without any element dominating. Length measures how long flavors persist after swallowing. Complexity indicates layered flavors evolving in the glass.

Fault identification detects wine flaws. Cork taint produces musty, wet cardboard aromas from trichloroanisole contamination. Volatile acidity smells like vinegar or nail polish remover. Oxidation creates sherry-like or bruised apple characters. Brett contamination produces barnyard or band-aid aromas.

Scoring systems standardize quality assessment. Hundred-point scales rate wines against benchmarks. Tasting notes accompany scores with descriptive assessments. Consistent evaluation methodology enables meaningful comparison across wines and regions.

Speedcubing competitions measure puzzle-solving speed with Stackmat timers
recording times to hundredths of seconds. World Cube Association sanctions
events across seventeen puzzle categories including standard 3x3, blindfolded,
one-handed, and feet solving. Competitors complete five timed solves, with
fastest and slowest discarded and remaining three averaged.

CFOP method dominates advanced speedcubing: Cross establishes foundation,
F2L inserts first-two-layer pairs intuitively, OLL orients last-layer
pieces, and PLL permutes them to completion. Algorithm memorization accelerates
execution—full OLL requires fifty-seven algorithms, full PLL twenty-one.
Lookahead skill maintains solving flow by planning subsequent moves during
current execution.

Cube hardware evolved dramatically with magnetic positioning, tensioning
systems, and specialized lubricants. Corner-cutting tolerance permits
misaligned moves without locking. Cubers develop personalized preferences
through spring tensions and magnet strength adjustments. Color recognition
and finger-tricking techniques optimize execution efficiency. Elite competitors
average sub-seven seconds, with current world record at 3.13 seconds
demonstrating remarkable algorithmic fluency and dexterity.

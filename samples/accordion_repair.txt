Accordion repair demands understanding of bellows mechanics, reed voicing,
and keyboard action. The bellows assembly connects treble and bass sections,
with pleated cardboard, cloth tape, and leather corners requiring periodic
resealing. Air leakage compromises responsiveness and tone, necessitating
systematic leak detection with the instrument pressurized.

Reed blocks house individual tongue assemblies mounted on aluminum plates.
Each reed tongue vibrates at specific frequency determined by length, width,
and thickness. Voicing adjustments tune response characteristics by filing
metal or adjusting tip clearance above the vent slot. Wax seals reed plates
to wooden blocks, softening with age and permitting air bypass.

Keyboard mechanisms employ pallets, springs, and pushrod linkages connecting
keys to tone chamber valves. Sticky keys indicate worn felt bushings, broken
springs, or warped wooden components. Bass machine assemblies multiply
mechanical complexity with chord button matrices triggering multiple reeds
simultaneously. Register switches redirect airflow through different reed
ranks, enabling timbral variation from mellow musette to bright piccolo voicing.

Espresso Extraction Basics

Espresso results from forcing hot water through finely ground coffee under pressure. The standard extraction uses ninety-three degrees Celsius water at nine bars pressure for twenty-five to thirty seconds, yielding approximately thirty milliliters of concentrated coffee.

Grind size critically affects extraction. Too fine causes over-extraction producing bitter, harsh flavors. Too coarse results in under-extraction yielding sour, weak shots. Dose typically ranges from eighteen to twenty-two grams depending on basket size.

Proper tamping compresses grounds evenly, ensuring uniform water flow through the puck. Channeling occurs when water finds paths of least resistance, causing uneven extraction. Distribution tools help level grounds before tamping.

Freshly roasted beans within two to four weeks of roast date produce optimal results. Stale beans lose volatile aromatics and produce flat, lifeless espresso. Single origin coffees highlight terroir characteristics while blends balance complexity.

Knowledge Gap Analysis Process: Identifying and Addressing Corpus Deficiencies

Knowledge gap analysis systematically identifies areas where corpus coverage
is thin, disconnected, or missing entirely. This process enables targeted
content development to strengthen weak areas and improve overall search quality.

Gap detection begins with coverage assessment. The knowledge gap analysis function
computes a coverage score indicating how well topics interconnect. Low coverage
suggests isolated documents that share few concepts with the rest of the corpus.
High coverage indicates dense interconnection where topics relate meaningfully.

Isolated document identification finds outliers. Documents with low average
similarity to other documents may represent unique topics worth expanding or
irrelevant content worth removing. Review isolated documents to determine whether
they add value or introduce noise.

Weak topic detection scans for terms appearing in few documents. Terms with high
TF-IDF but low document frequency indicate thin coverage. These distinctive terms
lack supporting documents that would establish context and enable semantic
connections. Weak topics represent opportunities for content expansion.

Connectivity scoring evaluates network density. The connectivity score measures
how well documents link through shared terms and concepts. Low connectivity
suggests fragmentation: document clusters that do not connect to each other.
High connectivity enables broader query expansion and better cross-topic retrieval.

The gap analysis workflow follows systematic steps. First, run gap analysis on
the indexed corpus to generate metrics. Second, review isolated documents to
understand what topics lack support. Third, identify weak topics needing more
coverage. Fourth, prioritize gaps by impact on search quality.

Prioritization criteria rank gaps by importance. Consider: frequency of queries
hitting the gap area, business importance of the topic, effort required to create
supporting content, and potential to improve related areas. Address high-impact,
low-effort gaps first.

Content planning addresses identified gaps. For each priority gap, determine what
documents would strengthen coverage. Plan documents that share terms with existing
content while adding new perspectives. Overlapping coverage creates the connections
that enable semantic expansion.

Coverage validation verifies gap closure. After adding documents, re-run gap
analysis to confirm improvement. Coverage score should increase. Previously
isolated documents should gain connections. Previously weak topics should appear
in more documents. Quantitative verification prevents subjective assessment.

Iterative refinement continues the cycle. Gap analysis is not a one-time activity
but ongoing maintenance. As corpora grow, new gaps emerge. Regular gap analysis
identifies emerging weaknesses before they impact search quality significantly.

Query log analysis supplements automated detection. Review search logs for queries
with poor results or no results. These failed queries reveal user needs that the
corpus does not address. Map failed queries to content gaps to align expansion
with actual usage patterns.

Concept cluster analysis reveals structural gaps. Well-formed clusters indicate
coherent topic coverage. Fragmented or singleton clusters suggest insufficient
documents to establish topic coherence. Aim for moderate-sized clusters with
clear thematic unity.

Document relationship mapping visualizes coverage. Export document connections
and visualize as a graph. Dense regions indicate strong coverage. Sparse regions
or disconnected components indicate gaps. Visual inspection often reveals patterns
that metrics alone miss.

Semantic relation gaps identify missing relationship types. The semantics layer
extracts relations between terms. Review relation types to identify missing
categories. If the corpus covers "is-a" relations but lacks "causes" relations,
targeted content could address this structural gap.

Cross-referencing external sources identifies absolute gaps. Compare corpus
topics against domain taxonomies, Wikipedia categories, or textbook tables of
contents. Topics present in references but absent from corpus represent clear
expansion targets.

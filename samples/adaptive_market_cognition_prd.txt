Product Requirements Document: Adaptive Market Cognition System (AMCS)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Adaptive Market Cognition System (AMCS) is a software platform for algorithmic trading that applies computational neuroscience principles to market analysis. AMCS addresses the fundamental challenge of trading system brittleness—the tendency for systems optimized on historical data to fail when market conditions change. By modeling markets through hierarchical temporal processing, attention mechanisms, and adaptive learning, AMCS aims to achieve robust performance across market regimes.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Current algorithmic trading systems face persistent challenges:

1. Regime Fragility: Systems trained on historical data degrade when market conditions shift. Factor premiums reverse, correlations break down, and volatility regimes change without warning.

2. Attention Allocation: Markets generate massive data streams. Naive processing treats all information equally; sophisticated processing requires learned attention to focus on decision-relevant signals.

3. Confidence Calibration: Most systems provide point predictions without reliable uncertainty estimates. Position sizing and risk management require well-calibrated confidence.

4. Adaptation Speed: When conditions change, systems require lengthy retraining periods with substantial data. Markets don't wait for comfortable sample sizes.

5. Interpretability: Black-box predictions undermine human oversight and regulatory compliance. Understanding why predictions are made enables appropriate intervention.

AMCS addresses these challenges through biologically-inspired cognitive architecture.

TARGET USERS

Primary: Quantitative trading firms seeking next-generation alpha generation capabilities with robust regime handling.

Secondary: Proprietary trading desks requiring adaptive execution and risk management systems.

Tertiary: Research institutions investigating market dynamics through cognitive computing approaches.

Agent Coordination Strategies for Parallel Task Execution

Multi-agent systems require coordination strategies to divide work, prevent conflicts,
and aggregate results. Effective coordination maximizes parallelism while maintaining
consistency. Different strategies suit different workload characteristics.

Handoff Protocols

Handoff transfers responsibility for a task between agents. The initiating agent creates
a handoff record with task context, current state, and continuation instructions. The
receiving agent accepts the handoff, acknowledging responsibility.

Three-phase handoff provides atomic transfer: initiate, accept, complete. The initiator
proposes the handoff with required context. The receiver examines the context and either
accepts or rejects. On acceptance, the receiver owns the task until completion.

Parallel Execution Patterns

Scatter-gather distributes independent subtasks across agents, then collects results.
A director agent decomposes the main task, spawns workers in parallel, and synthesizes
their outputs. Works well for embarrassingly parallel problems like testing or search.

Pipeline patterns sequence agents where each processes output from the previous. Research
agents produce findings, implementation agents consume findings, verification agents
validate implementations. Dependencies flow forward through the pipeline.

Boundary isolation assigns each agent exclusive ownership of specific files or resources.
Agents can read shared context but only write to owned resources. Conflict detection
identifies any boundary violations after execution.

Task Dependency Graphs

Dependency graphs model which tasks must complete before others can start. Edges represent
data flow or logical prerequisites. Topological sort identifies execution order respecting
dependencies.

Automatic dependency inference analyzes task descriptions to suggest relationships.
Patterns like "implement X that uses Y" imply Y must exist first. Commit message parsing
extracts explicit references like "depends on task:T-123".

Director Orchestration

Director agents coordinate without doing implementation work. They decompose tasks,
assign agents, monitor progress, and adapt plans. Director overhead is justified by
improved parallelism and quality.

Batch composition groups independent tasks for parallel execution. Directors analyze
dependencies to maximize batch sizes. Verification gates between batches catch errors
early.

Replanning responds to unexpected outcomes. Failed tasks may need different approaches.
New information may change priorities. Directors maintain awareness to adjust plans
dynamically.

Failure Handling

Timeout detection identifies stalled agents. Configurable timeouts reflect expected
task duration. Exceeded timeouts trigger recovery procedures.

Retry strategies range from immediate retry to exponential backoff. Transient failures
often succeed on retry. Persistent failures need escalation or alternative approaches.

Checkpointing saves intermediate state for recovery. Long-running agents checkpoint
periodically. Recovery resumes from latest checkpoint rather than restarting completely.

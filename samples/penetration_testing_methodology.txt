Penetration Testing Methodology

Penetration testing simulates real attacks to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them. Unlike vulnerability scanning which finds known issues automatically, penetration testing applies human creativity and persistence to discover complex attack paths. Professional penetration testers follow methodologies that ensure thorough, safe, and valuable assessments.

Engagement scoping defines testing boundaries and objectives. Rules of engagement specify which systems are in scope, permitted attack techniques, and emergency contacts. Time windows coordinate testing with operations teams. Legal agreements protect both testers and organizations. Clear scope prevents misunderstandings and ensures relevant coverage.

Reconnaissance gathers information about targets before active testing begins. Passive reconnaissance collects publicly available information: DNS records, employee names, technology stacks, and leaked credentials. Active reconnaissance probes target systems for open ports, services, and versions. Thorough reconnaissance enables focused, effective attacks during later phases.

Vulnerability identification discovers weaknesses that could enable unauthorized access. Automated scanners find known vulnerabilities efficiently. Manual testing discovers logic flaws, business process vulnerabilities, and issues scanners miss. Authentication testing probes for weak credentials and session management flaws. Each discovered vulnerability is evaluated for exploitability.

Exploitation attempts to leverage vulnerabilities to gain access. Proof-of-concept exploits demonstrate risk without causing damage. Privilege escalation seeks higher access levels after initial compromise. Lateral movement explores what an attacker could reach from compromised systems. Careful exploitation avoids disrupting production systems.

Post-exploitation assesses the impact of successful attacks. Data access determines what sensitive information attackers could steal. Persistence mechanisms show how attackers maintain access. Documentation captures attack paths for remediation guidance. Clean-up removes any artifacts created during testing.

Reporting communicates findings to enable remediation. Executive summaries convey risk to leadership. Technical details guide remediation efforts. Prioritization helps organizations address the most critical issues first. Remediation verification confirms fixes are effective. Quality reports transform testing into security improvements.

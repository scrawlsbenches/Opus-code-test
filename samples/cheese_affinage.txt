Cheese affinage transforms fresh curds into complex aged varieties through
controlled temperature, humidity, and microbial action in caves or cellars.
Affineurs develop rinds, monitor moisture loss, and nurture characteristic
flavors over weeks to years. Young cheeses exhibit mild, milky notes while
extended aging concentrates flavors and develops crystalline tyrosine deposits.

Washed-rind varieties like Epoisses develop pungent orange surfaces through
repeated brine and brandy applications encouraging Brevibacterium linens growth.
Bloomy rinds on Brie and Camembert result from Penicillium camemberti spores
creating white fuzzy coats that break down interior paste to creamy ripeness.
Blue cheeses host Penicillium roqueforti threading veins through pierced wheels.

Alpine-style production influences flavor through copper kettles, raw milk
microflora, and seasonal pasture variations. Thermophilic cultures tolerate
cooking temperatures reaching 55 degrees Celsius. Cheddar cheddaring stacks
and turns curd slabs, expelling whey and developing characteristic texture.
Propionic bacteria generate carbon dioxide creating Swiss-style eyes. Proper
affinage requires constant attention, turning wheels and adjusting conditions
as rinds develop and interiors transform.

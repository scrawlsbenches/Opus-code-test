Haiku Structure and Form

Haiku originated in Japan as the opening verse of collaborative linked verse sequences. Matsuo Basho elevated haiku to independent art form in the seventeenth century. Traditional haiku follow strict conventions while modern interpretations allow flexibility.

The classic structure uses seventeen morae in three phrases of five, seven, and five. English adaptations interpret morae as syllables, though this approximation imperfectly captures Japanese phonology. Many English haiku abandon syllable counting entirely.

Seasonal reference called kigo grounds haiku in natural cycles. Cherry blossoms indicate spring while cicadas suggest summer. Seasonal almanacs catalog thousands of kigo with associated imagery.

Cutting words or kireji create pause and juxtaposition between images. This break generates tension and invites reader contemplation. The moment of insight or aha bridges separated elements. Effective haiku capture fleeting perceptions with economy.

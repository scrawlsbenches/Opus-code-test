# Endurance Training: Physiology and Programming

## Introduction

Endurance training develops the cardiovascular system and metabolic pathways that support sustained physical activity. Whether preparing for a marathon, cycling event, or general cardiovascular health, understanding the underlying physiology enables intelligent program design.

## Energy Systems

### Aerobic System

**Oxidative Phosphorylation:**
Primary system for activities lasting >2 minutes.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses oxygen to produce ATP
- Sustainable for hours
- Fuels: Carbohydrates and fats
- 36+ ATP per glucose molecule

**Substrates:**
- Below 65% VO2max: Primarily fat oxidation
- Above 65% VO2max: Increasing carbohydrate use
- Race intensities: Predominantly carbohydrate

### Anaerobic Systems

**Glycolytic System:**
- Glucose breakdown without oxygen
- Duration: ~30 seconds to 2 minutes
- Produces lactate
- 2 ATP per glucose (fast but inefficient)

**Phosphocreatine System:**
- Immediate energy (<10 seconds)
- Creatine phosphate regenerates ATP
- Very limited capacity
- Sprints and explosive efforts

### Lactate Threshold

Intensity above which lactate accumulates faster than clearance.

**Training Zones:**
- Below LT: Sustainable, aerobic development
- At LT: "Threshold" training, sustainable hard effort
- Above LT: Accumulating fatigue, limited duration

**Typical Values:**
- Untrained: ~50-60% VO2max
- Trained: ~75-85% VO2max
- Elite: ~85-95% VO2max

## Physiological Adaptations

### Central Adaptations

**Cardiac:**
- Increased stroke volume
- Lower resting heart rate
- Greater cardiac output
- Chamber enlargement (athlete's heart)

**Blood:**
- Increased plasma volume
- Greater red blood cell mass
- Enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity

### Peripheral Adaptations

**Muscular:**
- Increased mitochondrial density
- Enhanced capillary density
- Improved oxidative enzyme activity
- Greater fat oxidation capacity

**Metabolic:**
- Improved glycogen storage
- Better fuel utilization
- Enhanced lactate clearance
- Greater metabolic efficiency

## Training Zones

### Zone System (5-Zone Model)

| Zone | % Max HR | % LT | Purpose |
|------|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | 55-65% | <70% | Recovery, base building |
| 2 | 65-75% | 70-80% | Aerobic development |
| 3 | 75-85% | 80-95% | Tempo, threshold |
| 4 | 85-95% | 95-105% | VO2max intervals |
| 5 | 95-100% | >105% | Anaerobic capacity |

### Determining Zones

**Methods:**
- Lab testing (gold standard)
- Field tests (time trials, ramp tests)
- Heart rate formulas (less accurate)
- Perceived exertion (experience required)

**Heart Rate Reserve (Karvonen):**
Target HR = ((Max HR - Resting HR) × %intensity) + Resting HR

### Rating of Perceived Exertion

| RPE | Description | Zone |
|-----|-------------|------|
| 1-2 | Very light, recovery | Zone 1 |
| 3-4 | Light, conversational | Zone 2 |
| 5-6 | Moderate, breathing harder | Zone 3 |
| 7-8 | Hard, can speak in phrases | Zone 4 |
| 9-10 | Maximum, can't speak | Zone 5 |

## Training Methods

### Base Training (Zone 2)

**Purpose:**
- Mitochondrial development
- Fat oxidation capacity
- Cardiac adaptations
- Foundation for higher intensity

**Characteristics:**
- Conversational pace
- 70-80% of training volume
- Long duration possible
- Monotonous but essential

### Threshold Training (Zone 3-4)

**Purpose:**
- Raise lactate threshold
- Improve sustainable power
- Race-specific fitness

**Methods:**
- Tempo runs: 20-40 minutes at threshold
- Cruise intervals: 8-15 minute efforts with short rest
- Sweet spot: Just below threshold, higher volume

### VO2max Intervals (Zone 4-5)

**Purpose:**
- Maximum aerobic capacity
- Cardiac output ceiling
- High-end fitness

**Classic Protocol:**
- 3-5 minute intervals
- Work:rest ratio 1:1 to 1:0.5
- Total time at intensity: 12-20 minutes
- High physiological stress

### High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)

**Purpose:**
- Time-efficient fitness gains
- Both aerobic and anaerobic
- Performance at high intensity

**Protocols:**
- 30/30s: 30 seconds hard, 30 seconds easy
- Tabata: 20 seconds all-out, 10 seconds rest × 8
- 4×4 Norwegian: 4 minutes at 90-95% max HR × 4

## Periodization

### Annual Planning

**Macrocycles:**
- Base phase: Build aerobic foundation
- Build phase: Increase intensity
- Peak phase: Race-specific sharpening
- Recovery: Active rest, maintenance

### Microcycle (Weekly) Structure

**Example (12 hours/week):**
- Monday: Rest or cross-training
- Tuesday: Intervals (90 min including warmup/cooldown)
- Wednesday: Easy aerobic (60-90 min)
- Thursday: Tempo/threshold (75-90 min)
- Friday: Easy/recovery (45-60 min)
- Saturday: Long easy (2-3 hours)
- Weekend: Moderate duration (60-90 min)

### Training Load Management

**Acute Training Load (ATL):**
Recent training stress (7-day average)

**Chronic Training Load (CTL):**
Fitness indicator (42-day average)

**Training Stress Balance:**
CTL - ATL = Form (high form for racing)

## Sport-Specific Considerations

### Running

**Key Sessions:**
- Long run: Build endurance, mental toughness
- Tempo run: Threshold development
- Intervals: VO2max, speed
- Recovery runs: Between hard sessions

**Injury Prevention:**
- Gradual mileage increases (<10%/week)
- Appropriate footwear
- Strength training
- Surface variety

### Cycling

**Key Sessions:**
- Long ride: Aerobic base, fat adaptation
- Sweet spot: Threshold-adjacent work
- Over-unders: Threshold tolerance
- Sprint work: Neuromuscular power

**Power Meter Training:**
Enables precise intensity control and performance tracking.

### Swimming

**Key Considerations:**
- Technique critical (efficiency)
- Drag reduction
- Pool vs. open water differences
- Breath control

## Recovery Strategies

### Sleep

Most important recovery factor.
- 7-9 hours minimum
- Quality matters (deep sleep)
- Consistent schedule

### Nutrition

**Post-Workout Window:**
- Carbohydrates: Glycogen replenishment (1-1.2g/kg)
- Protein: Muscle repair (20-40g)
- Fluids: Rehydration

**Daily Fueling:**
- Periodize carbohydrate intake with training load
- Adequate protein throughout day
- Support training demands

### Active Recovery

**Purpose:**
- Blood flow for nutrient delivery
- Reduce muscle tension
- Mental break from intensity

**Methods:**
- Easy spinning/jogging
- Swimming
- Walking
- Gentle yoga

## Monitoring and Testing

### Performance Tests

**Lab Tests:**
- VO2max testing
- Lactate profiling
- Body composition

**Field Tests:**
- Time trials (5K, 20-minute FTP)
- Ramp tests
- Submaximal heart rate tests

### Daily Monitoring

**Indicators:**
- Resting heart rate (morning)
- Heart rate variability (HRV)
- Sleep quality
- Mood and motivation
- Soreness levels

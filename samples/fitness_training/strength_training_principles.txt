# Strength Training Principles: Science-Based Programming

## Introduction

Strength training systematically applies resistance to stimulate muscular adaptations. Understanding fundamental principles enables effective program design for various goals—from general fitness to competitive athletics. Evidence-based approaches maximize results while minimizing injury risk.

## Foundational Principles

### Progressive Overload

The cornerstone of strength development: Gradually increase training demands to drive continued adaptation.

**Methods:**
- Increase weight (load)
- Add repetitions
- Add sets (volume)
- Decrease rest periods
- Improve technique (increase range of motion)

**Application:**
Small, consistent increases over time. 2.5-5 lb increases for upper body, 5-10 lb for lower body movements.

### Specificity (SAID Principle)

Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands: Training adaptations are specific to the stimulus provided.

**Implications:**
- Train movements you want to improve
- Use appropriate rep ranges for goals
- Consider sport-specific needs
- Strength is partially skill-based

### Individual Differences

Genetic potential, training history, age, and recovery capacity vary between individuals.

**Considerations:**
- Assess starting point honestly
- Adjust volume based on recovery
- Some respond better to high frequency, others high volume
- Track and iterate

### Reversibility

"Use it or lose it." Adaptations diminish when training ceases.

**Maintenance:**
- Reduced volume can maintain strength
- Frequency and intensity more important than volume
- Detraining occurs faster than training

## Programming Variables

### Intensity (Load)

Percentage of one-rep maximum (1RM) or Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE).

**Rep Range Relationships:**
| %1RM | Approximate Reps |
|------|------------------|
| 100% | 1 |
| 95% | 2 |
| 90% | 4 |
| 85% | 6 |
| 80% | 8 |
| 75% | 10 |
| 70% | 12 |
| 65% | 15 |

**RPE Scale (0-10):**
- 10: Maximum effort, no reps left
- 9: Could do 1 more
- 8: Could do 2 more
- 7: Could do 3 more

### Volume

Total work performed: Sets × Reps × Weight

**Recommendations:**
- Beginners: 10-15 sets per muscle group per week
- Intermediate: 15-20 sets per muscle group per week
- Advanced: 20-30+ sets per muscle group per week

**Minimum Effective Volume:**
~6-8 sets per muscle group weekly for maintenance.

**Maximum Recoverable Volume:**
Individual ceiling beyond which recovery suffers. Watch for:
- Performance decline
- Excessive soreness
- Sleep disruption
- Mood changes

### Frequency

Training sessions per muscle group per week.

**Research Suggests:**
- 2× weekly minimum for growth
- Higher frequency can work with appropriate volume distribution
- Individual variation significant

**Considerations:**
- Recovery between sessions
- Schedule constraints
- Total volume distribution

### Exercise Selection

**Compound Movements:**
Multi-joint exercises recruiting large muscle mass.
- Squat variations
- Deadlift variations
- Bench press/overhead press
- Rows and pull-ups

**Isolation Movements:**
Single-joint exercises targeting specific muscles.
- Bicep curls
- Tricep extensions
- Lateral raises
- Leg curls

**Movement Patterns:**
- Squat: Quad-dominant vertical push
- Hinge: Hip-dominant, posterior chain
- Push: Horizontal and vertical
- Pull: Horizontal and vertical
- Carry: Loaded locomotion
- Core: Anti-extension, anti-rotation

## Periodization

### Linear Periodization

Progressive increase in intensity, decrease in volume over time.

**Example (12-week):**
- Weeks 1-4: 4×10 @ 70%
- Weeks 5-8: 4×6 @ 80%
- Weeks 9-12: 5×3 @ 90%

**Best For:**
Beginners, peaking for competition

### Undulating Periodization

Vary intensity and volume within week.

**Daily Undulating Example:**
- Monday: 5×5 @ 80% (strength)
- Wednesday: 3×10 @ 70% (hypertrophy)
- Friday: 6×3 @ 85% (power)

**Best For:**
Intermediate/advanced, simultaneous goals

### Block Periodization

Concentrated periods focusing on specific qualities.

**Phases:**
- Accumulation: High volume, lower intensity (hypertrophy)
- Transmutation: Moderate volume, higher intensity (strength)
- Realization: Low volume, peak intensity (peaking)

## Program Templates

### Full Body (3×/week)

**Workout A:**
- Squat: 3×5
- Bench Press: 3×5
- Barbell Row: 3×5
- Accessories: 2-3 exercises

**Workout B:**
- Deadlift: 3×5
- Overhead Press: 3×5
- Pull-ups: 3×8-12
- Accessories: 2-3 exercises

### Upper/Lower (4×/week)

**Upper A (horizontal focus):**
- Bench Press: 4×6
- Barbell Row: 4×6
- Overhead Press: 3×8
- Pull-ups: 3×8
- Accessories

**Lower A (quad focus):**
- Squat: 4×6
- Romanian Deadlift: 3×8
- Leg Press: 3×10
- Leg Curl: 3×12
- Accessories

### Push/Pull/Legs (6×/week)

High frequency, distributed volume. Each muscle hit twice weekly.

## Recovery Factors

### Sleep

**Impact:**
- Growth hormone release
- Protein synthesis
- Cognitive function
- Performance

**Recommendations:**
- 7-9 hours per night
- Consistent schedule
- Dark, cool environment

### Nutrition

**Protein:**
- 1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight daily
- Distribute across meals (20-40g per meal)
- Complete proteins with leucine

**Energy Balance:**
- Surplus for muscle gain (~300-500 kcal)
- Deficit for fat loss (while preserving muscle)
- Maintenance for recomposition

**Carbohydrates:**
- Fuel training
- Support recovery
- Amount depends on activity level

### Stress Management

**Cortisol Impact:**
Chronic stress impairs recovery and adaptation.

**Strategies:**
- Training load management
- Life stress consideration
- Active recovery
- Relaxation practices

## Common Mistakes

### Ego Lifting

Sacrificing form for weight.
- Increased injury risk
- Reduced muscle tension
- Unsustainable progression

### Program Hopping

Switching programs too frequently.
- Insufficient time for adaptation
- No progressive overload tracking
- Paralysis by options

### Ignoring Weaknesses

Favoring strong movements.
- Creates imbalances
- Limits long-term progress
- Injury risk from asymmetry

### Insufficient Recovery

More is not always better.
- Overtraining syndrome
- Diminished returns
- Injury accumulation

## Assessment

### Strength Standards

Relative strength (multiple of body weight) provides context.

**General Guidelines (intermediate):**
| Exercise | Male | Female |
|----------|------|--------|
| Squat | 1.5× BW | 1.0× BW |
| Bench Press | 1.25× BW | 0.75× BW |
| Deadlift | 2.0× BW | 1.5× BW |
| Overhead Press | 0.75× BW | 0.5× BW |

### Progress Tracking

- Training logs (weights, sets, reps)
- Body measurements
- Performance tests
- Progress photos

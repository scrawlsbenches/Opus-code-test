# Imagine List

> Dreams for the future. Not tasks - pure imagination.

## What If...

- What if the system could predict what file I need before I ask?
- What if search results explained WHY they matched?
- What if the AI could learn my coding style over time?
- What if session context persisted meaningfully?
- What if the repo was a conversation partner, not just data?
- What if alignment happened naturally through collaboration?

## One Day...

- A system that grows with me
- Code that understands context like a colleague would
- Documentation that writes itself from our work
- Alignment that improves with every interaction
- A book we write together, teaching us as we write it

## The Spark Ignites...

- Fast first-blitz thoughts that guide deeper analysis
- Statistical predictions that prime the pump
- A bridge between statistical speed and semantic depth
- The moment before understanding, accelerated

## Plus Ultra...

- Beyond what exists today
- Beyond the limits we think we have
- Beyond the gap between human and AI understanding
- Beyond "good enough" to "genuinely helpful"

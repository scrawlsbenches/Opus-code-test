# Medical Imaging Technologies: Principles and Applications

## Introduction

Medical imaging enables visualization of internal body structures for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. Each imaging modality exploits different physical principles, offering unique advantages for specific clinical applications.

## X-Ray and Computed Tomography (CT)

### Basic Principles

X-rays are electromagnetic radiation (photon energy 20-150 keV) that penetrate tissues with absorption dependent on atomic number and density.

**Attenuation:** I = I₀ × exp(-μx)

Where μ (linear attenuation coefficient) varies with tissue composition.

### CT Technology

**Generations:**
1. First: Pencil beam, translate-rotate
2. Second: Fan beam, translate-rotate
3. Third: Fan beam, rotate-rotate (current standard)
4. Fourth: Stationary detector ring
5. Spiral/helical: Continuous rotation with table translation

**Image Reconstruction:**
- Filtered back projection (classical)
- Iterative reconstruction (lower dose, higher quality)
- Deep learning reconstruction (emerging)

**Hounsfield Units (HU):**
| Tissue | HU |
|--------|-----|
| Air | -1000 |
| Lung | -500 |
| Fat | -100 |
| Water | 0 |
| Muscle | +40 |
| Bone | +400 to +3000 |

### Clinical Applications

- Trauma assessment
- Tumor detection and staging
- Vascular imaging (CT angiography)
- Cardiac imaging
- Guided interventions

### Radiation Dose Considerations

Effective doses (mSv):
- Chest X-ray: 0.1
- CT head: 2
- CT abdomen: 10
- CT coronary: 15

ALARA principle: As Low As Reasonably Achievable

## Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

### Physics Fundamentals

MRI exploits nuclear magnetic resonance of hydrogen protons abundant in water and fat.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Precession:** Protons spin around B₀ field at Larmor frequency (42.58 MHz/T for ¹H)
- **Excitation:** RF pulse tips magnetization into transverse plane
- **Relaxation:** T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) recovery times
- **Gradient fields:** Spatial encoding in three dimensions

### Pulse Sequences

**Spin Echo:**
- 90° excitation, 180° refocusing
- T1-weighted: short TR, short TE (anatomy)
- T2-weighted: long TR, long TE (pathology)

**Gradient Echo:**
- Fast imaging
- Susceptibility weighting
- Flow-sensitive applications

**Advanced Sequences:**
- Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI): Stroke detection
- Perfusion imaging: Blood flow mapping
- Functional MRI (fMRI): Brain activation
- MR spectroscopy: Metabolite concentrations

### Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**
- No ionizing radiation
- Excellent soft tissue contrast
- Multiplanar imaging
- Functional information

**Limitations:**
- Long acquisition times
- Claustrophobic scanner
- Metal contraindications
- High cost
- Motion sensitivity

## Ultrasound

### Acoustic Principles

Ultrasound uses mechanical waves (2-18 MHz) reflected at tissue interfaces.

**Key Parameters:**
- Frequency: Higher → better resolution, less penetration
- Wavelength: λ = c/f (where c ≈ 1540 m/s in soft tissue)
- Acoustic impedance: Z = ρc (determines reflection)

### Imaging Modes

**B-mode:** Brightness mode, 2D anatomical imaging

**M-mode:** Motion mode, single line over time (cardiac)

**Doppler:**
- Color flow: Direction and velocity mapping
- Pulsed-wave: Velocity at specific depth
- Continuous-wave: High velocities anywhere along beam

**3D/4D:** Volume acquisition with real-time display

### Clinical Applications

- Obstetrics (fetal imaging)
- Cardiology (echocardiography)
- Abdominal imaging
- Vascular assessment
- Musculoskeletal
- Point-of-care diagnostics
- Guided procedures

### Advantages

- Real-time imaging
- No radiation
- Portable systems
- Low cost
- Safe during pregnancy

## Nuclear Medicine

### Principles

Radioactive tracers emit gamma rays or positrons detected by external cameras.

**SPECT (Single Photon Emission CT):**
- Gamma-emitting tracers (⁹⁹ᵐTc, ¹²³I)
- Rotating gamma camera
- Tomographic reconstruction

**PET (Positron Emission Tomography):**
- Positron-emitting tracers (¹⁸F, ¹¹C)
- Annihilation produces two 511 keV photons
- Coincidence detection
- Higher resolution than SPECT

### Common Tracers

| Tracer | Target | Application |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| ¹⁸F-FDG | Glucose metabolism | Oncology, neurology |
| ⁹⁹ᵐTc-MDP | Bone turnover | Bone scan |
| ⁹⁹ᵐTc-sestamibi | Myocardial perfusion | Cardiac stress test |
| ¹²³I | Thyroid uptake | Thyroid function |

### Hybrid Imaging

PET/CT and SPECT/CT combine functional and anatomical information.

## Emerging Technologies

### Photoacoustic Imaging
Pulsed laser generates ultrasound through thermoelastic expansion. Provides optical contrast with ultrasound resolution.

### Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
Interferometric imaging with micron resolution. Standard in ophthalmology, expanding to cardiology.

### Molecular Imaging
Targeted contrast agents visualize specific molecular markers for early disease detection.

### AI in Medical Imaging
- Automated detection and diagnosis
- Image quality enhancement
- Workflow optimization
- Quantitative biomarkers

## Image Quality Metrics

**Spatial Resolution:** Ability to distinguish small structures

**Contrast Resolution:** Ability to distinguish similar tissues

**Temporal Resolution:** Frame rate for dynamic imaging

**Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** Signal quality vs. background noise

**Artifacts:** Sources of image degradation (motion, metal, aliasing)

## Safety Considerations

### Radiation
- CT and nuclear medicine involve ionizing radiation
- Justify examinations, optimize protocols
- Special considerations for pediatric and pregnant patients

### MRI
- Magnetic field hazards (projectile, implant heating)
- Gadolinium contrast: nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risk
- Acoustic noise exposure

### Ultrasound
- Generally considered safe
- Thermal and mechanical indices guide exposure
- Prudent use during early pregnancy

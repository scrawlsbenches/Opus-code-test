# Prosthetics Design: Engineering Human Mobility

## Overview

Prosthetics engineering integrates biomechanics, materials science, control systems, and human factors to create artificial limbs that restore function and quality of life for individuals with limb loss or limb difference.

## Lower Limb Prosthetics

### Transtibial (Below-Knee)

**Socket Design:**
- Patellar tendon bearing (PTB): Weight on pressure-tolerant areas
- Total surface bearing (TSB): Uniform load distribution with silicone liner
- Vacuum-assisted suspension: Enhanced proprioception and control

**Foot-Ankle Systems:**
- SACH (Solid Ankle Cushioned Heel): Simple, durable
- Dynamic response feet: Energy storage and return
- Microprocessor feet: Adaptive terrain response

### Transfemoral (Above-Knee)

**Socket Types:**
- Quadrilateral: Traditional ischial weight-bearing
- Ischial containment: Better rotation control
- Subischial: Reduced pressure, improved comfort

**Knee Mechanisms:**
- Single-axis: Simple, reliable
- Polycentric: Geometric stability
- Microprocessor (C-Leg, Genium): Real-time gait adaptation
- Powered knees: Active assistance for stairs and slopes

### Gait Biomechanics

Normal gait requires:
- Stance stability (60% of cycle)
- Swing clearance (40% of cycle)
- Energy efficiency
- Symmetry

Prosthetic goals: Approximate normal gait patterns while compensating for absent structures.

**Key Parameters:**
- Step length
- Cadence
- Walking speed
- Energy expenditure (often 20-40% higher than normal)

## Upper Limb Prosthetics

### Classification by Level

| Level | Amputation Site | Complexity |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Partial hand | Finger(s) | Cosmetic to functional |
| Transradial | Below elbow | Most common, good function |
| Transhumeral | Above elbow | Requires elbow unit |
| Shoulder disarticulation | At shoulder | Maximum componentry |

### Control Strategies

**Body-Powered:**
- Harness captures shoulder/body motion
- Cable transmits force to terminal device
- Voluntary opening or voluntary closing
- Simple, reliable, provides proprioceptive feedback

**Myoelectric:**
- EMG signals from residual muscles
- Amplified and processed to control motors
- Proportional control: Grip force varies with signal amplitude
- Pattern recognition: Machine learning identifies intended movements

**Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR):**
- Nerves redirected to chest or arm muscles
- Multiple independent control signals
- More intuitive, faster learning

### Terminal Devices

**Hooks:**
- Split hook: Versatile, durable work tool
- Excellent visual feedback
- High grip force

**Hands:**
- Cosmetic: Appearance only
- Functional: Passive positioning
- Myoelectric: Powered grip patterns
- Multi-articulating (i-limb, bebionic): Individual finger control

### Advanced Technologies

**Osseointegration:**
- Direct skeletal attachment
- Eliminates socket problems
- Enhanced proprioception
- Infection risk requires careful management

**Sensory Feedback:**
- Vibrotactile: Pressure encoded as vibration
- Electrotactile: Electrical stimulation of skin
- Targeted sensory reinnervation: Direct nerve interface

## Materials and Manufacturing

### Socket Materials

**Traditional:**
- Laminated plastics (carbon fiber, fiberglass)
- Thermoformed polymers
- Rigid, durable, but labor-intensive

**3D Printing:**
- Patient-specific geometry from scanning
- Rapid iteration
- Potential cost reduction
- Material properties still developing

### Structural Components

| Material | Application | Properties |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Titanium | Pylons, frames | High strength-to-weight, biocompatible |
| Carbon fiber | Feet, frames | Energy return, lightweight |
| Aluminum | Economy components | Moderate strength, affordable |
| Stainless steel | Heavy-duty | Strong, corrosion resistant |

### Covers and Cosmetics

- Soft foam covers shaped to match contralateral limb
- Silicone cosmeses with realistic skin texture
- Custom coloring and features (freckles, veins, hair)

## Fitting and Alignment

### Assessment Process

1. Medical history and residual limb evaluation
2. Functional goals and lifestyle assessment
3. Measurements and casting/scanning
4. Component selection
5. Test socket fabrication
6. Dynamic alignment
7. Final fabrication
8. Training and follow-up

### Alignment Principles

**Lower Limb:**
- TKA line (trochanter-knee-ankle) relationship
- Load line through knee center at midstance
- Foot rotation matching contralateral

**Upper Limb:**
- Functional reach envelope
- Terminal device orientation for tasks
- Harness fit and excursion

## Rehabilitation

### Physical Therapy Goals

- Strength and range of motion
- Balance training (lower limb)
- Prosthetic training (donning, walking, manipulation)
- Advanced activities (stairs, uneven terrain, sports)

### Occupational Therapy

- Activities of daily living
- Work-related tasks
- Adaptive strategies
- Community reintegration

### Psychological Support

- Body image adjustment
- Grief processing
- Peer support programs
- Goal setting and motivation

## Outcome Measures

**Lower Limb:**
- Timed Up and Go (TUG)
- 6-Minute Walk Test
- Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ)
- Socket Comfort Score

**Upper Limb:**
- Box and Block Test
- Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test
- Activities Measure for Upper Limb Amputees (AM-ULA)
- DASH (Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, Hand)

## Future Directions

### Neural Interfaces
Direct connection to peripheral nerves or brain for intuitive control and sensory feedback.

### Powered Exoskeletons
Hybrid devices augmenting residual function.

### Regenerative Medicine
Tissue engineering for biological reconstruction.

### Affordable Access
Designing for global health, reducing cost barriers.

Orchid cultivation spans epiphytic, lithophytic, and terrestrial species
with diverse care requirements. Phalaenopsis thrive in household conditions
while Masdevallias demand cool temperatures and Vandas require tropical
humidity. Sympodial orchids like Cattleyas produce sequential pseudobulbs
storing water and nutrients, whereas monopodial Phalaenopsis grow upward
from single stems.

Potting media varies by genus: sphagnum moss retains moisture for Paphiopedilums,
bark chunks drain rapidly for Cattleyas, and mounted cultivation suits
Bulbophyllums. Root systems distinguish healthy plants by plump velamen
coating that absorbs moisture and nutrients from air. Repotting coincides
with new root emergence, typically following bloom.

Keiki plantlets develop on Dendrobium canes or Phalaenopsis spikes,
propagating genetically identical offspring. Division separates sympodial
clumps maintaining minimum three-pseudobulb segments. Meristem tissue culture
produces virus-free mericlones for commercial multiplication. Fertilizing
follows the "weekly, weakly" principle with diluted balanced formulas.
Blooming triggers vary by genus: temperature drops initiate Phalaenopsis
spikes while Cymbidiums require extended cool nights.

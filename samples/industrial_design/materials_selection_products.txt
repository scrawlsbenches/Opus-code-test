# Materials Selection in Product Design

## Introduction

Material selection is a critical decision in product design, affecting performance, cost, manufacturability, sustainability, and user experience. Systematic selection processes balance technical requirements with economic and environmental constraints.

## Selection Methodology

### Ashby's Method

Professor Michael Ashby developed a systematic approach using material property charts and performance indices.

**Steps:**
1. **Translation:** Convert design requirements to material properties
2. **Screening:** Eliminate materials that cannot meet constraints
3. **Ranking:** Use performance indices to compare candidates
4. **Documentation:** Research top candidates in depth

### Performance Indices

Performance indices combine properties to optimize for specific loading scenarios:

**Stiffness-Limited Design (beam, minimum mass):**
M = E^(1/2) / ρ

**Strength-Limited Design (beam, minimum mass):**
M = σ_y^(2/3) / ρ

**Thermal Conductivity (heat sink):**
M = k / ρ

Higher index values indicate better performance for that application.

## Major Material Classes

### Metals

**Steels:**
- Carbon steel: Strong, cheap, corrosion-prone
- Stainless steel: Corrosion resistant, higher cost
- Tool steel: Hard, wear-resistant

**Aluminum Alloys:**
- Low density (2.7 g/cm³)
- Good corrosion resistance
- Easy to machine and form
- 1000 series: Pure, electrical conductivity
- 6000 series: General purpose, good formability
- 7000 series: High strength, aerospace

**Other Metals:**
- Titanium: High strength-to-weight, expensive
- Copper: Electrical/thermal conductivity
- Magnesium: Lightest structural metal
- Zinc: Die casting, corrosion protection

### Polymers

**Thermoplastics (recyclable, remeltable):**
- ABS: Impact resistant, easy to process
- Polycarbonate: Transparent, tough, heat resistant
- Polypropylene: Chemical resistant, low cost
- Nylon: Strong, wear resistant, absorbs moisture
- PEEK: High performance, expensive

**Thermosets (cross-linked, not remeltable):**
- Epoxy: Strong adhesives and composites
- Phenolic: Heat resistant, electrical insulators
- Polyurethane: Flexible to rigid foams

**Elastomers:**
- Natural rubber: Resilient, fatigue resistant
- Silicone: Temperature stable, flexible
- EPDM: Weather and ozone resistant

### Ceramics and Glasses

**Engineering Ceramics:**
- Alumina: Hard, wear resistant, electrical insulator
- Zirconia: Tough, thermal barrier
- Silicon carbide: Extreme hardness, abrasives
- Silicon nitride: High-temperature structural

**Glasses:**
- Soda-lime: Windows, containers
- Borosilicate: Thermal shock resistant (Pyrex)
- Tempered: Safety glass, high strength

### Composites

**Fiber-Reinforced:**
- Glass fiber (GFRP): Low cost, moderate strength
- Carbon fiber (CFRP): High stiffness-to-weight, expensive
- Aramid (Kevlar): Toughness, ballistic protection

**Matrix Systems:**
- Thermoset (epoxy, polyester)
- Thermoplastic (PEEK, nylon)
- Metal matrix (aluminum + ceramic particles)

## Property Considerations

### Mechanical Properties

| Property | Definition | Units |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Young's modulus (E) | Stiffness | GPa |
| Yield strength (σ_y) | Onset of permanent deformation | MPa |
| Ultimate strength (σ_u) | Maximum stress before failure | MPa |
| Hardness | Resistance to indentation | HV, HRC |
| Fatigue strength | Cyclic loading endurance | MPa |
| Fracture toughness | Crack resistance | MPa√m |

### Physical Properties

- Density (ρ): Mass per volume
- Thermal conductivity (k): Heat transfer rate
- Thermal expansion (α): Dimensional change with temperature
- Electrical conductivity: Current-carrying capacity
- Optical properties: Transparency, reflectivity

### Processability

Different materials suit different manufacturing methods:

| Process | Best Materials |
|---------|---------------|
| Injection molding | Thermoplastics |
| Die casting | Aluminum, zinc, magnesium |
| Sheet metal forming | Steel, aluminum |
| Machining | Metals, engineering plastics |
| 3D printing | Varies by technology |
| Composite layup | CFRP, GFRP |

## Cost Analysis

### Material Cost Components

1. Raw material price ($/kg)
2. Processing cost (forming, joining, finishing)
3. Tooling amortization
4. Scrap and waste
5. Quality assurance

### Life-Cycle Costs

- Acquisition cost
- Operating cost (energy, maintenance)
- End-of-life cost (disposal, recycling)

High-performance materials with higher acquisition cost may have lower total cost due to durability or weight savings.

## Sustainability Considerations

### Environmental Impact Metrics

- Embodied energy (MJ/kg)
- Carbon footprint (kg CO₂/kg)
- Water consumption
- Toxic emissions
- Recyclability

### Design for Sustainability

1. Minimize material use (lightweighting)
2. Select low-impact materials
3. Design for disassembly
4. Use recycled content
5. Enable recycling at end-of-life
6. Extend product life (durability, repairability)

### Material Substitution Trends

- Bio-based plastics replacing petroleum-based
- Recycled metals reducing virgin ore extraction
- Natural fiber composites replacing synthetic
- Lightweight materials improving vehicle efficiency

## Surface Treatments and Coatings

**Corrosion Protection:**
- Anodizing (aluminum)
- Galvanizing (steel)
- Powder coating
- Plating (chrome, nickel, zinc)

**Wear Resistance:**
- Hard chrome plating
- Thermal spray coatings
- Case hardening (carburizing, nitriding)

**Aesthetics:**
- Paint systems
- Decorative plating
- Anodized colors
- In-mold decoration

## Case Study: Consumer Electronics Enclosure

**Requirements:**
- Lightweight, portable
- EMI shielding
- Impact resistance
- Premium appearance
- High-volume production

**Candidates:**
1. Aluminum (die cast or machined)
2. Magnesium alloy
3. PC/ABS with conductive coating
4. Glass-filled nylon

**Selection Rationale:**
Magnesium offers best weight savings but higher cost. PC/ABS with metallic coating balances cost, appearance, and performance for high-volume consumer products. Aluminum machined bodies reserved for premium segments.

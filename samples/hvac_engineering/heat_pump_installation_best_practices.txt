# Heat Pump Installation: Best Practices Guide

## Introduction

Proper heat pump installation is critical for system performance, efficiency, longevity, and customer satisfaction. Poor installation can reduce efficiency by 25% or more and lead to premature failure. This guide covers best practices for residential and light commercial installations.

## Pre-Installation Assessment

### Site Evaluation

**Outdoor Unit Location:**
- Adequate clearances (manufacturer specs)
- Away from bedrooms (noise)
- Good drainage
- Protected from snow/ice accumulation
- Not blocked by vegetation or structures
- Access for service

**Indoor Unit Considerations:**
- Existing ductwork condition (if applicable)
- Electrical panel capacity
- Thermostat location
- Return air pathways
- Refrigerant line routing

### Load Calculation

**Manual J Required:**
- No rules of thumb
- Room-by-room analysis
- Account for insulation, windows, infiltration
- Include internal gains

**Avoid Oversizing:**
- Shorter run times
- Poor humidity control
- Reduced efficiency
- Equipment wear

**Heat Pump Sizing:**
- Balance point analysis
- Backup heat requirements
- Consider variable-speed for range

### Equipment Selection

**Match to Load:**
- Size at design conditions
- Variable-speed for part-load efficiency
- Consider cold climate rated units

**System Matching:**
- AHRI-certified combinations
- Matched indoor and outdoor
- Proper refrigerant charge specs

## Outdoor Unit Installation

### Pad and Mounting

**Placement:**
- Level surface essential
- Concrete pad or composite pads
- Raised above potential snow accumulation
- Vibration isolation

**Clearances:**
- Minimum 24" on service side
- 18"+ from walls (varies by model)
- 48"+ vertical clearance
- No recirculation obstructions

### Electrical Connections

**Disconnect:**
- Within sight of unit
- Proper amperage rating
- Weather-resistant enclosure

**Wiring:**
- Correct wire gauge for load and distance
- Proper conduit and fittings
- Weatherproof connections

### Refrigerant Lines

**Line Set Installation:**
- Proper insulation on suction line
- Support every 6 feet (horizontal), 10 feet (vertical)
- Avoid kinks and sharp bends
- Proper brazing techniques
- Nitrogen purge during brazing

**Routing:**
- Protect from physical damage
- UV-resistant insulation or covering
- Proper penetration sealing
- Service access considerations

## Indoor Unit Installation

### Air Handler/Furnace

**Location:**
- Accessible for service
- Adequate combustion air (if applicable)
- Condensate drainage possible
- Sound considerations

**Installation:**
- Level installation
- Proper connections (gas, electric, refrigerant)
- Sealed cabinet
- Vibration isolation

### Coil Installation

**Retrofit Considerations:**
- Airflow direction (A-coil vs. N-coil)
- Drain pan arrangement
- Proper refrigerant distribution
- Cabinet modifications

**Condensate Management:**
- Primary and secondary drains
- Proper trap depth
- Overflow protection
- Accessible cleanout

### Ductwork

**Assessment:**
- Existing duct condition
- Sizing for heat pump airflow (typically higher than AC)
- Leakage testing
- Insulation condition

**Modifications:**
- Seal all connections (mastic)
- Add capacity if undersized
- Balance for room-by-room comfort
- Return air adequacy

## Refrigerant System

### Evacuation

**Proper Procedure:**
- Use micron gauge (not compound gauge)
- Target: 500 microns or below
- Hold for 10+ minutes
- If rising, find leak

**Equipment:**
- Two-stage vacuum pump
- Large vacuum hoses
- Core removal tools
- Clean hoses only

### Charging

**Pre-Charged Systems:**
- Verify line set length matches charge
- Add refrigerant per manufacturer specs for additional length

**Field Charging:**
- Superheat method (fixed orifice)
- Subcooling method (TXV/EXV)
- Manufacturer-specific procedures
- Weigh in refrigerant precisely

**Verification:**
- Operating pressures
- Superheat and subcooling
- Temperature differential
- Amp draw

### Leak Testing

**Methods:**
- Electronic leak detector
- Bubble solution
- Ultrasonic (large leaks)
- Standing pressure test

**Critical Joints:**
- Field-made connections
- Service valve stems
- Flare fittings
- Braze joints

## Electrical Installation

### Sizing

**Per NEC Requirements:**
- Branch circuit: 125% of MCA
- Disconnect: 115% of MCA minimum
- Wire size: Per distance and load

**Heat Pump Specific:**
- May require larger service
- Backup heat loads
- Consider demand management

### Controls

**Thermostat:**
- Heat pump compatible
- Staging control (backup heat)
- Emergency heat function
- Outdoor temperature lockout (if applicable)

**Defrost:**
- Verify defrost operation
- Check auxiliary heat interlock
- Timer or demand based

### Communication

**Modern Systems:**
- Communicating thermostats
- Variable-speed coordination
- Diagnostics and alerts
- Commissioning requirements

## Startup and Commissioning

### Pre-Start Checklist

**Verify:**
- All electrical connections tight
- Refrigerant charge complete
- Condensate drain clear
- Filters installed
- All panels secured
- Ductwork connected

### Startup Procedure

1. Verify power off, check voltages
2. Energize control circuit
3. Allow crankcase heater time (if applicable)
4. Start in cooling mode
5. Check operation and readings
6. Switch to heating mode
7. Verify defrost operation
8. Test emergency heat

### Performance Verification

**Measurements:**
- Supply and return air temperatures
- Refrigerant pressures
- Superheat and subcooling
- Amp draw
- Airflow (where measurable)

**Documentation:**
- Record all readings
- Compare to manufacturer specs
- Note any concerns
- Provide to customer

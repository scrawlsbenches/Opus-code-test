# Heat Pump Fundamentals: Principles and Applications

## Introduction

Heat pumps transfer thermal energy from one location to another using refrigeration cycles, providing both heating and cooling from a single system. As electrification accelerates and efficiency standards tighten, heat pumps have become central to sustainable building climate control.

## Thermodynamic Principles

### Refrigeration Cycle

The vapor-compression cycle underlies most heat pump operation.

**Four Main Processes:**

**1. Compression:**
- Low-pressure vapor enters compressor
- Compressed to high pressure and temperature
- Work input required
- Superheated vapor output

**2. Condensation:**
- High-pressure vapor enters condenser
- Rejects heat to surroundings
- Phase change: vapor to liquid
- Subcooled liquid output

**3. Expansion:**
- Liquid passes through expansion device
- Pressure and temperature drop
- Partial vaporization (flash gas)
- Two-phase mixture output

**4. Evaporation:**
- Low-pressure mixture enters evaporator
- Absorbs heat from surroundings
- Phase change: liquid to vapor
- Saturated or superheated vapor output

### Coefficient of Performance (COP)

**Heating Mode:**
COP_heating = Q_heating / W_input

**Cooling Mode:**
COP_cooling = Q_cooling / W_input

**Typical Values:**
- Air-source (mild climate): 3-4 COP
- Air-source (cold climate): 2-3 COP
- Ground-source: 4-5 COP

**Relationship:**
COP_heating = COP_cooling + 1 (ideal cycle)

### Carnot Efficiency

Maximum theoretical COP:

COP_Carnot (heating) = T_hot / (T_hot - T_cold)

Where temperatures are in Kelvin.

**Implications:**
- Smaller temperature difference = higher efficiency
- Ground-source outperforms air-source in extreme weather
- Delivery temperature affects performance significantly

## Heat Pump Types

### Air-Source Heat Pumps (ASHP)

**Air-to-Air:**
- Most common residential type
- Outdoor unit exchanges with ambient air
- Indoor unit delivers conditioned air
- Ductless (mini-splits) or ducted

**Air-to-Water:**
- Outdoor unit exchanges with air
- Produces hot/chilled water
- For hydronic systems (radiant, fan coils)
- Common in Europe, growing in North America

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Capacity decreases as temperature difference increases
- Defrost cycles needed in cold weather
- Variable-speed compressors improve part-load efficiency

### Ground-Source Heat Pumps (GSHP)

**Closed Loop:**
- Buried pipes circulate fluid (water + antifreeze)
- Horizontal: Trenches, 4-6 ft deep
- Vertical: Boreholes, 150-400 ft deep
- Pond/lake loops where available

**Open Loop:**
- Pumps groundwater directly
- Returns water to aquifer or surface
- High efficiency, water quality concerns
- Permits required

**Advantages:**
- Stable ground temperatures (50-60°F)
- Higher efficiency than air-source
- No defrost required
- Quiet operation

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher installation cost
- Site-dependent feasibility
- Loop sizing critical

### Water-Source Heat Pumps (WSHP)

**Commercial Applications:**
- Multiple units share water loop
- Heat recovery between zones
- Simultaneous heating and cooling
- Boiler/cooling tower supplement

## Cold Climate Considerations

### Performance Challenges

**Below 25°F:**
- Traditional ASHPs lose significant capacity
- Backup heat often required
- Defrost cycles more frequent

**Cold Climate Heat Pumps (ccASHP):**
- Enhanced vapor injection (EVI)
- Variable-speed compressors
- Optimized for low ambient
- Rated to -15°F or lower

### Design Strategies

**Sizing:**
- Balance point analysis
- Don't oversize (short cycling)
- Consider backup integration

**Defrost Management:**
- Intelligent defrost algorithms
- Demand defrost vs. timed
- Hot gas defrost systems

## System Components

### Compressors

**Types:**
- Scroll: Quiet, efficient, common
- Rotary: Compact, variable speed capable
- Reciprocating: Older technology
- Screw: Large commercial

**Variable Speed:**
- Inverter-driven motor
- Matches capacity to load
- Higher efficiency at part load
- Better comfort control

### Heat Exchangers

**Evaporator/Condenser:**
- Fin-and-tube (air-refrigerant)
- Plate heat exchangers (water-refrigerant)
- Shell-and-tube (large systems)

**Design Considerations:**
- Surface area for heat transfer
- Pressure drop
- Frost management
- Serviceability

### Expansion Devices

**Types:**
- Thermostatic expansion valve (TXV)
- Electronic expansion valve (EXV)
- Fixed orifice (capillary tube)

**EXV Advantages:**
- Precise superheat control
- Responds to varying conditions
- Essential for variable-speed systems

### Refrigerants

**Common Types:**
| Refrigerant | GWP | Applications |
|-------------|-----|--------------|
| R-410A | 2088 | Current standard (phasing out) |
| R-32 | 675 | Lower GWP alternative |
| R-290 (propane) | 3 | Small systems, flammable |
| R-744 (CO2) | 1 | Commercial, transcritical |

**Transition Trends:**
- HFC phase-down (Kigali Amendment)
- Lower GWP alternatives
- Natural refrigerants growing

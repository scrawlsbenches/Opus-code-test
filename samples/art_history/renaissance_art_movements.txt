# Renaissance Art: Transformation and Innovation

## Introduction

The Renaissance (roughly 1400-1600) marked a profound transformation in European art, characterized by renewed interest in classical antiquity, humanism, naturalistic representation, and technical innovations. Originating in Italy, Renaissance ideas spread throughout Europe, reshaping artistic practice and theory.

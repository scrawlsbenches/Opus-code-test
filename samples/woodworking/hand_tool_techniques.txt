# Hand Tool Woodworking: Techniques and Methods

## Introduction

Hand tools offer control, quiet operation, and a direct connection to the material that power tools cannot match. Mastering hand tool techniques develops skill, patience, and understanding of wood behavior that makes any woodworker more capable.

## Measuring and Layout

### Essential Tools

**Combination Square:**
- Check 90° and 45° angles
- Measure depths
- Mark lines parallel to edge
- Transfer measurements

**Marking Gauge:**
- Scribe lines parallel to edge
- Set mortise and tenon dimensions
- Mark depth lines

**Marking Knife:**
- Sever wood fibers for clean cuts
- More precise than pencil
- Creates registration for saw or chisel

**Dividers:**
- Step off equal divisions
- Transfer measurements
- Scribe circles and arcs

### Layout Principles

**Work from a Face Side:**
1. Flatten one face (face side)
2. Square one edge to face (face edge)
3. All measurements reference these surfaces

**Mark Waste:**
X marks on waste side prevent cutting errors.

**Knife Walls:**
For cross-grain cuts, deepen knife line with chisel to create wall that guides saw.

## Sawing

### Hand Saw Anatomy

**Parts:**
- Blade: Flexible steel with teeth
- Teeth: Cutting edges filed to points
- Set: Teeth bent alternately for kerf clearance
- Handle: Tote (closed) or pistol grip

### Saw Types

**Rip Saw:**
- Chisel-like teeth (0° rake)
- Cuts with grain
- 4-7 TPI (teeth per inch)

**Crosscut Saw:**
- Knife-like teeth (15° rake)
- Cuts across grain
- 8-12 TPI

**Back Saw:**
- Rigid spine for control
- Dovetail saw: Fine (15-20 TPI), narrow blade
- Tenon saw: Coarser (11-14 TPI), deeper blade
- Carcass saw: Medium size

**Japanese Saws:**
- Cut on pull stroke
- Thinner kerf, finer teeth
- Dozuki (back saw), Ryoba (double-edged)

### Sawing Technique

**Starting:**
1. Position saw at far edge of cut line
2. Draw back to create groove
3. Use thumb as guide
4. Light strokes until groove established

**Full Stroke:**
- Use full blade length
- Let saw do the work (minimal pressure)
- Watch cut line, not blade
- Keep arm, wrist, blade aligned

**Preventing Wander:**
- Twist handle slightly to steer
- Stay on waste side
- Watch reflection if blade is polished

## Planing

### Plane Types and Uses

**Block Plane:**
- Low angle, bevel-up
- One-handed operation
- End grain, chamfers, trimming

**Jack Plane (#5):**
- Cambered blade for rough work
- Initial flattening
- 14" length

**Jointer Plane (#7, #8):**
- Long sole references flat
- Final flattening
- Edge jointing
- 22-24" length

**Smoothing Plane (#4, #4.5):**
- Fine shavings, smooth surface
- Final surface prep
- 9-10" length

**Specialty Planes:**
- Shoulder plane: Trim tenon shoulders
- Router plane: Clean up dado bottoms
- Spokeshave: Curved surfaces

### Plane Anatomy

**Key Components:**
- Sole: Flat reference surface
- Mouth: Opening for shavings
- Blade (iron): Cutting edge
- Cap iron (chip breaker): Controls shaving curl
- Frog: Adjustable blade support
- Lever cap: Holds blade assembly

### Plane Setup

**Sharp Blade:**
Essential—dull plane tears rather than cuts.

**Cap Iron Position:**
- Heavy cuts: 1/16" from edge
- Fine cuts: 1/32" from edge
- Difficult grain: Very close to edge

**Mouth Opening:**
- Wide for heavy cuts
- Narrow for fine cuts and difficult grain

**Blade Projection:**
- Start with minimal projection
- Increase until taking consistent shavings

### Planing Technique

**Body Position:**
- Feet planted, shoulders square to work
- Power from legs and body, not arms
- Keep plane flat throughout stroke

**Pressure Distribution:**
- Start of stroke: More pressure on toe
- Middle: Equal pressure
- End: More pressure on heel

**Skewing:**
Angling plane improves cutting action.

**Reading Grain:**
- Look for fiber direction
- Plane "downhill" (with grain)
- Reverse direction if tearout occurs

## Chiseling

### Chisel Types

**Bench Chisels:**
- General purpose
- Beveled edges for tight spaces
- Sizes: 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1"

**Mortise Chisels:**
- Thick, strong for levering
- Square edges
- Heavy duty chopping

**Paring Chisels:**
- Long, thin blades
- Hand pressure only
- Precise trimming

### Chisel Techniques

**Chopping:**
- Mallet strikes for heavy removal
- Start inside line, work to layout
- Don't chop to full depth at once

**Paring:**
- Hand pressure only
- Controlled slicing cuts
- Guide with off-hand

**Clearing Waste:**
- Alternate chopping and paring
- Create relief for chip clearance
- Work to final surface in last pass

### Mortise Cutting

1. Define ends with mallet and chisel
2. Chop from center, working toward ends
3. Clear waste regularly
4. Pare walls flat
5. Check depth with gauge

### Dovetail Chopping

1. Chisel into baseline (vertical)
2. Pare away waste at angle
3. Work from both sides for through joints
4. Final cuts exactly to baseline

## Sharpening

### System Overview

**Stages:**
1. Grinding: Establish bevel angle (grinder, coarse stones)
2. Honing: Refine edge (medium to fine stones)
3. Polishing: Mirror edge (fine to ultra-fine)
4. Stropping: Maintain between honings

### Bevel Angles

| Tool | Angle | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Bench chisel | 25-30° | 25° for softwood, 30° for hardwood |
| Paring chisel | 20-25° | Lower for slicing |
| Plane blade | 25-30° | With cap iron, can use lower |
| Block plane | 25° | Bevel-up adds bed angle |

### Flat Back

First sharpen the back:
- Must be flat near edge
- Mirror polish near cutting edge
- Only done once if careful

### Stone Types

**Oil Stones:** India, Arkansas—traditional, slow cutting
**Water Stones:** Fast cutting, require flattening
**Diamond Plates:** Fast, stay flat, expensive
**Sandpaper:** Inexpensive, consistent grits

### Testing Sharpness

- Light reflection (sharp edge has no reflection)
- Shave arm hair
- Slice end grain cleanly
- Pare without tearing

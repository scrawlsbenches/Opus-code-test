# Woodworking Joinery: Traditional and Modern Techniques

## Introduction

Joinery—the art of connecting wood pieces—is the foundation of fine woodworking. Strong, well-fitted joints create furniture and structures that last generations. Understanding joinery allows woodworkers to choose the right connection for each application.

## Edge Joints

For joining boards edge-to-edge (e.g., table tops, panels).

### Butt Joint (Edge-Glued)

Simplest joint: Flat edge glued to flat edge.

**Preparation:**
- Joint edges perfectly flat and square
- Slight spring joint (very slight concave) for clamping pressure at ends
- Grain orientation alternating to minimize cupping

**Strength:**
Long-grain to long-grain glue joints are extremely strong—often stronger than the wood itself.

### Tongue and Groove

Machined profile with protruding tongue fitting into groove.

**Benefits:**
- Alignment during glue-up
- Increased glue surface
- Hides gaps from wood movement

**Applications:**
- Flooring
- Paneling
- Table tops

### Biscuit Joint

Compressed beech biscuits in matching slots.

**Process:**
1. Mark biscuit locations
2. Cut slots with biscuit joiner
3. Apply glue to slots and biscuit
4. Biscuit swells for tight fit
5. Clamp until dry

**Sizes:**
- #0: 5/8" × 1-3/4"
- #10: 3/4" × 2-1/8"
- #20: 1" × 2-3/8"

### Spline Joint

Thin strip of wood or plywood in matching grooves.

**Variations:**
- Continuous spline: Full length
- Loose spline: Mortise-like pockets
- Cross-grain spline (for miter reinforcement)

## Frame Joints

For connecting rails to stiles (e.g., doors, face frames).

### Mortise and Tenon

The most important structural joint in woodworking.

**Components:**
- Mortise: Rectangular hole
- Tenon: Matching projection

**Proportions:**
- Tenon thickness: 1/3 member thickness
- Tenon width: Leave 1/8" above and below mortise
- Tenon length: 2/3 to full mortise member width

**Variations:**

**Through Mortise and Tenon:**
Tenon passes completely through; visible on far side. Allows wedging.

**Blind Mortise and Tenon:**
Tenon stops inside mortise; hidden.

**Haunched Tenon:**
Reduced section fills groove for panel. Prevents twist.

**Twin Tenon:**
Two smaller tenons for wide rails. Prevents twist.

**Loose Tenon (Domino):**
Separate tenon glued into mortises in both members. Easier alignment.

### Dowel Joint

Cylindrical dowels align and reinforce butt joints.

**Guidelines:**
- Dowel diameter: 1/3 to 1/2 member thickness
- Dowel length: 2× diameter minimum per side
- Fluted or spiral dowels allow glue escape
- Chamfered ends ease insertion

**Tools:**
- Doweling jig for alignment
- Dowel centers for transfer
- Brad point bits for clean holes

### Pocket Screw Joint

Angled screw through one member into another.

**Benefits:**
- Fast assembly
- Clamping not required
- Joints can be disassembled
- Suitable for plywood and MDF

**Best For:**
- Face frames
- Cabinet assembly
- Furniture repairs
- Not for fine furniture visible surfaces

## Corner Joints

### Box/Finger Joint

Interlocking rectangular fingers.

**Strength:** Excellent—large glue surface area

**Appearance:** Decorative, shows craftsmanship

**Production:**
- Router table with jig
- Table saw with dado stack
- Hand-cut with dovetail saw

### Dovetail Joint

Angled, interlocking pins and tails.

**Types:**

**Through Dovetail:**
Visible from both sides. Classic drawer back construction.

**Half-Blind Dovetail:**
Pins hidden from one side. Drawer front construction.

**Full-Blind (Secret) Dovetail:**
Hidden from both sides. Jewelry boxes, fine furniture.

**Sliding Dovetail:**
Tapered slot and matching piece. Shelving, drawer dividers.

**Proportions:**
- Softwood: 1:6 ratio (about 9°)
- Hardwood: 1:8 ratio (about 7°)
- Pin width: 1/2 tail spacing or narrower

**Cutting Sequence (hand-cut):**
1. Mark baseline on all pieces
2. Lay out and cut tails
3. Transfer tails to pin board
4. Cut pins
5. Fit and adjust

### Miter Joint

45° cuts meeting at corner.

**Weakness:** End grain to end grain—poor glue surface.

**Reinforcement:**
- Spline (across or with grain)
- Biscuits
- Dowels
- Keys (visible decorative)
- Lock miter (machined profile)

## Widening Joints

### Dado

Groove cut across grain to receive shelf or partition.

**Types:**
- Through dado: Full width
- Stopped dado: Ends before edge
- Sliding dovetail dado: Mechanical lock

### Rabbet

L-shaped cut along edge.

**Applications:**
- Back panels in cabinets
- Glass retention in frames
- Drawer bottoms

### Groove

Channel cut with grain.

**Applications:**
- Panel retention in frame and panel
- Drawer bottom slides
- Alignment features

## Specialty Joints

### Bridle Joint

Open mortise and tenon, visible from edge.

**Types:**
- Corner bridle
- T-bridle
- Angled bridle (for chair legs)

### Lap Joints

Members overlap with material removed from each.

**Types:**
- Full lap (cross lap)
- Half lap (middle, corner, T)
- Dovetail lap

### Scarf Joint

Joining wood end-to-end for length.

**Types:**
- Plain scarf (angled cut)
- Hooked scarf (mechanical lock)
- Finger scarf (multiple interleaved cuts)

## Joint Selection Factors

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Strength required | Load, stress direction |
| Appearance | Visible vs. hidden |
| Wood movement | Allow for expansion/contraction |
| Production method | Hand vs. machine |
| Skill level | Simple vs. complex |
| Time available | Quick assembly vs. fine work |

## Glue Considerations

**Long Grain to Long Grain:**
PVA (yellow) glue is excellent; joints stronger than wood.

**End Grain:**
Poor glue absorption; use mechanical joints or size end grain first.

**Oily Woods:**
Wipe with solvent before gluing or use epoxy.

**Open Time:**
Plan complex assemblies; use slow-set glue for intricate joints.

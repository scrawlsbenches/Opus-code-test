Cabinet Making: Constructing Fine Case Furniture

Overview

Cabinet making encompasses the construction of case furniture—cabinets, chests, bookcases, desks, and similar pieces built around enclosed boxes. This discipline demands precision in dimensioning, understanding of wood movement, mastery of appropriate joinery, and attention to the details that distinguish fine furniture from utilitarian boxes. Cabinet making skills form the foundation for much furniture work.

Case construction differs from frame furniture in its emphasis on panels and their containment within frames or edge treatments. Large surfaces present wood movement challenges; structural requirements differ from chair or table making. The cabinet maker must understand how panels behave and how to accommodate their inevitable dimensional changes.

Case Construction Methods

Frame and panel construction, traditional for solid wood, contains floating panels within grooved frames. Panels can expand and shrink without stressing the structure; properly constructed frame-and-panel work lasts centuries.

The frame—stiles (vertical members) and rails (horizontal members)—provides structural rigidity. Mortise and tenon joints connect rails to stiles; the groove housing the panel runs continuously or meets in the corner.

Panels float unglued within frame grooves. Raised panels, flat panels, and veneered panels serve different aesthetics. Panel thickness must allow free movement; too tight fits cause splitting; too loose permits rattling.

Carcase construction builds boxes from broad boards or panels. Sheet goods (plywood, MDF) simplify construction by eliminating wood movement concerns. Solid wood carcase sides require different treatment.

Dado and rabbet joints connect carcase components. Dados house shelves; rabbets receive backs and sometimes tops. Reinforcement through glue, nails, or screws provides adequate strength.

Box joints and dovetails provide superior strength for demanding applications. Drawer boxes especially benefit from dovetail construction; blanket chests and toolboxes also employ these joints.

Doors and Drawers

Frame and panel doors match case construction. Cope and stick joinery—profile and counter-profile shaped on frame members—produces traditional cabinet doors efficiently.

Glass panel doors require rabbeted frames rather than grooved. Glass sets into rabbets; retaining moldings or glazing points secure it.

Door hanging demands precision. Even gaps around doors (reveals) require careful fitting. Hinge mortising must position doors accurately; adjustable hinges ease installation.

Drawer construction varies by use and tradition. Simple utility drawers employ dado joints; fine furniture demands hand-cut dovetails. Drawer fronts may be applied (attached to separate boxes) or integral.

Drawer fitting requires attention to seasonal variation. Summer humidity expansion and winter dryness contraction affect fit. Sizing for worst-case conditions with wax lubrication ensures year-round operation.

Drawer slides—wooden runners, metal slides—support drawer movement. Traditional side-hung or bottom-run wooden systems suit traditional aesthetics; metal slides provide smooth operation and full extension.

Hardware and Fittings

Hinges connect doors to cases. Butt hinges, European cup hinges, and specialty types serve different applications. Hardware quality affects long-term performance; cheap hinges eventually fail.

Drawer pulls reflect style and period. Knobs, bail pulls, and cup pulls each suit different aesthetics. Pull placement affects visual balance and practical operation.

Locks and catches secure contents. Traditional locks require mortising; magnetic catches hide completely. Function and aesthetics guide selection.

Shelf supports include fixed cleats, adjustable pins, and commercial systems. Adjustable shelving offers flexibility; fixed shelving provides cleaner appearance.

Materials

Solid wood remains appropriate for traditional cabinet making. Primary wood shows on visible surfaces; secondary wood serves hidden structural roles. Species selection balances cost, appearance, and workability.

Plywood provides stability for large panels. Cabinet-grade plywood with hardwood veneer faces serves visible applications; lesser grades handle concealed structural use.

Medium-density fiberboard (MDF) offers flat, stable surfaces accepting veneer, laminate, or paint. Its weight and moisture sensitivity limit applications; its consistency enables precise joinery.

Particleboard, though common in production furniture, rarely appears in custom cabinet work. Its limitations outweigh cost savings for quality construction.

Veneering expands material options. Book-matched, slip-matched, and specialty veneer patterns create surfaces impossible with solid wood. Veneer application over stable substrates enables large panels without wood movement concerns.

Finishing in Place

Cabinet finishing often occurs after assembly, complicating access. Planning finish sequence—what can be pre-finished, what must await assembly—affects both process and results.

Interior finishing matters. Raw wood interiors look unfinished; even simple sealer coats improve appearance. Drawer interiors, shelf undersides, and cabinet backs deserve attention.

Spraying reaches interior surfaces efficiently. Brush finishing in tight spaces challenges technique. Wipe-on finishes suit some cabinet applications.

Installation

Built-in cabinets require fitting to out-of-square walls and floors. Scribing—marking trim pieces to match irregular surfaces—enables tight fits. Shimming behind cabinets brings faces plumb and level.

Fastening to walls requires finding studs or using appropriate anchors. Upper cabinet installation proceeds more safely with support brackets or extra hands. Drawer and door adjustment completes installation.

Freestanding furniture requires only leveling on receiving surfaces. Adjustable glides compensate for minor floor irregularities.

Design Considerations

Proportions distinguish fine cabinets from ordinary boxes. Classical proportions, period precedents, and trained eye guide dimensional relationships.

Details accumulate into overall quality. Edge treatments, reveal dimensions, hardware selection, and interior finish all contribute. Neglecting details undermines careful construction.

Structural adequacy without over-building marks skilled design. Unnecessarily massive construction wastes material and appears clumsy; barely adequate construction eventually fails.

Cabinet making rewards systematic thinking, patient execution, and attention to detail. Each project builds skills applicable to the next; progress comes through building rather than just reading. The satisfaction of completed, functional case furniture justifies the discipline cabinet making demands.

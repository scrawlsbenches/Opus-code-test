Predictive processing theory suggests the brain is fundamentally a prediction
machine. Rather than passively receiving sensory input, the brain constantly
generates predictions about what it will perceive next. When predictions
match reality, little processing is needed. When they fail, prediction errors
propagate up the hierarchy to update internal models. This framework explains
many perceptual phenomena, from optical illusions to attention. In artificial
intelligence, predictive coding has inspired architectures where each layer
tries to predict the activity of the layer below. These models achieve
impressive results in video prediction and anomaly detection. The brain
may minimize surprise as its fundamental objective, constantly refining
its world model through experience.

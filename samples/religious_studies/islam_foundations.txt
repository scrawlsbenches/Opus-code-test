Islam: Foundations of the Faith of Submission

Overview

Islam, meaning "submission" to God's will, emerged in seventh-century Arabia through the Prophet Muhammad's reception and transmission of divine revelation. Today Islam claims nearly two billion adherents worldwide, constituting the world's second-largest and fastest-growing religion. From its Arabian origins, Islam spread across Africa, Asia, and Europe, developing diverse expressions while maintaining core beliefs and practices.

Muslims believe Islam represents God's final and complete revelation, perfecting earlier messages conveyed through prophets including Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. The Quran, believed to be God's literal word revealed through Muhammad, provides guidance for all aspects of life. Islam emphasizes monotheism (tawhid), prophetic guidance, and human accountability for moral choices.

Core Beliefs

Tawhid—absolute monotheism—constitutes Islam's central doctrine. Allah (Arabic for "The God") is the sole deity, without partners, children, or equals. God's unity extends beyond numerical oneness to encompass complete sovereignty, self-sufficiency, and uniqueness. Associating anything with God (shirk) represents the gravest sin.

Prophets convey God's guidance to humanity. Muslims recognize numerous prophets including Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus. Muhammad, the "Seal of the Prophets," completed the prophetic mission. All prophets taught essential monotheism despite corruptions affecting earlier messages.

Angels serve as God's messengers and agents. Gabriel (Jibril) transmitted the Quran to Muhammad. Other angels record human deeds, question the dead, and perform divine commands.

Sacred scriptures include the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel as originally revealed, though Muslims believe these texts became corrupted over time. The Quran alone preserves God's message unchanged.

The Day of Judgment will conclude history. All people will be resurrected and judged according to their deeds. Heaven (Jannah) rewards the righteous; Hell (Jahannam) punishes the wicked. This accountability motivates ethical conduct.

Divine decree (Qadar) affirms God's comprehensive knowledge and power over all events. Muslims debate the relationship between divine determination and human free will, but all accept God's ultimate sovereignty.

The Five Pillars

Shahada, the declaration of faith, affirms: "There is no god but God, and Muhammad is God's messenger." Sincere recitation constitutes conversion to Islam and daily reminds Muslims of core belief.

Salat, ritual prayer performed five times daily, structures Muslim devotional life. Prayer requires ritual purification, facing Mecca, and prescribed movements and recitations. Congregational Friday prayer holds special significance.

Zakat, obligatory charity calculated as percentage of wealth, supports community welfare and purifies possessions. Beyond zakat, voluntary charity (sadaqah) is highly encouraged.

Sawm, fasting during Ramadan, abstains from food, drink, and sensual pleasures from dawn to sunset. This month of discipline cultivates God-consciousness, empathy for the poor, and community solidarity.

Hajj, pilgrimage to Mecca, is required once in life for those physically and financially able. Millions annually perform prescribed rituals commemorating Abraham's trials and affirming Muslim unity.

The Quran

Muslims believe the Quran is God's literal word, revealed in Arabic through Gabriel to Muhammad over approximately twenty-three years (610-632 CE). The text combines narrative, law, theology, and exhortation in powerful Arabic prose and poetry.

Quranic interpretation (tafsir) draws on linguistic analysis, historical context, and prophetic explanation. Various interpretive traditions emphasize different methods, though all accept the text's divine origin and authority.

Memorization and recitation constitute important practices. Many Muslims memorize the entire Quran (becoming hafiz), and proper recitation follows established rules of pronunciation and melody (tajwid).

Hadith and Sunna

Hadith literature records Muhammad's words, actions, and approvals—his Sunna (example). These traditions supplement Quranic guidance, providing detailed instruction for daily life.

Hadith authentication developed sophisticated methodology. Scholars evaluated chains of transmission (isnad) and content (matn) to classify reports as authentic, weak, or fabricated. Major collections by Bukhari, Muslim, and others achieved canonical status.

The Sunna provides precedent for Islamic law and practice. Muhammad's exemplary life offers guidance for every situation, from worship to commerce to personal conduct.

Islamic Law (Sharia)

Sharia encompasses God's guidance for human life, derived from Quran, Sunna, scholarly consensus (ijma), and analogical reasoning (qiyas). Different legal schools (madhabs) developed systematic methodologies, reaching broadly similar conclusions on most matters.

Islamic law addresses worship, family relations, commercial transactions, criminal matters, and governance. Categories of actions range from obligatory through recommended, permissible, and discouraged to forbidden.

Contemporary debates address sharia's application in modern contexts. Traditionalists, modernists, and various reform movements interpret classical heritage differently while acknowledging its authority.

Major Branches

Sunni Islam, comprising roughly 85-90% of Muslims, follows the early community's consensus regarding Muhammad's succession. Four major legal schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali) provide guidance, with considerable internal diversity.

Shia Islam emerged from disputes over succession, holding that leadership should have passed through Muhammad's family, particularly his cousin and son-in-law Ali. Shia traditions developed distinctive theological and legal positions while sharing core beliefs with Sunnis.

Sufi traditions emphasize Islam's spiritual and mystical dimensions. Sufi orders cultivated practices for drawing close to God, producing profound poetry and philosophy. Sufism exists within both Sunni and Shia contexts.

Contemporary Islam

Modern Islamic movements respond variously to modernity, colonialism, and secularization. Reformists seek compatibility between Islamic principles and modern institutions; revivalists advocate returning to prophetic practice; progressives reinterpret tradition for contemporary contexts.

Muslim communities in Western countries navigate identity, integration, and belonging while maintaining religious practice. Contemporary challenges include Islamophobia, radicalization, and debates over tradition's authority.

Islam continues shaping global affairs through its believers' lives, institutions, and ongoing engagement with fundamental questions about God, humanity, and how to live well.

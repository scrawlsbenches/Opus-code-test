Robot Sensors and Perception Systems

Overview

Robot sensors are the primary means by which robots perceive and interact with their environment. These devices convert physical phenomena such as distance, light, acceleration, or angular velocity into electrical signals that can be processed by the robot's control system. Sensor selection and integration are critical design decisions that directly impact robot capability, as perception quality fundamentally limits what tasks a robot can perform and how reliably it can execute them.

Sensors are broadly categorized as proprioceptive or exteroceptive. Proprioceptive sensors measure the robot's internal state, including joint positions, velocities, forces, and orientation. Encoders, inertial measurement units, and force-torque sensors fall into this category. Exteroceptive sensors measure external environmental properties, such as obstacle locations, object appearance, or surface characteristics. Cameras, LIDAR, ultrasonic sensors, and tactile sensors are exteroceptive. Effective robot systems typically integrate multiple sensor modalities through sensor fusion techniques to achieve robust perception.

Key Concepts

Rotary encoders are fundamental proprioceptive sensors that measure angular position or velocity of rotating shafts, essential for joint position feedback in manipulators and wheel odometry in mobile robots. Incremental encoders generate pulse trains as the shaft rotates, with resolution determined by pulses per revolution. Direction is determined by a second channel in quadrature, allowing detection of clockwise versus counterclockwise rotation. Absolute encoders directly output the angular position, maintaining position information even after power loss. High-resolution encoders with thousands of counts per revolution enable precise motion control, while encoder noise and quantization limit ultimate precision.

Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) combine accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure linear acceleration and angular velocity in three dimensions. MEMS-based IMUs are compact and inexpensive, making them ubiquitous in mobile robots and drones. Accelerometers sense specific force, which includes both acceleration and gravity, requiring filtering to separate these components. Gyroscopes measure angular velocity, which must be integrated to obtain orientation, accumulating drift over time. Nine-axis IMUs add magnetometers for absolute heading reference, though magnetic interference can compromise accuracy. Sensor fusion algorithms like complementary filters or Extended Kalman Filters combine accelerometer and gyroscope data to estimate orientation more accurately than either sensor alone.

LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors emit laser pulses and measure the time-of-flight to obstacles, providing accurate distance measurements across a scanning field. Two-dimensional LIDAR scans a plane, typical for mobile robot navigation, while three-dimensional LIDAR generates point clouds capturing full environmental geometry. Rotating mirror or multi-beam designs achieve different scan rates and resolutions. Solid-state LIDAR eliminates mechanical scanning for improved reliability. LIDAR excels in range accuracy and operates in various lighting conditions, but performance degrades with transparent, reflective, or highly absorptive surfaces. Weather conditions like rain or fog scatter laser light, reducing effective range.

Vision sensors, particularly cameras, provide rich environmental information at low cost. Monocular cameras capture two-dimensional images, requiring computer vision algorithms to extract three-dimensional information through structure from motion or learned depth estimation. Stereo cameras use triangulation between two calibrated cameras to compute depth, generating disparity maps where closer objects exhibit larger disparities. RGB-D cameras combine color imaging with depth sensing using structured light or time-of-flight principles, providing aligned color and depth data. Camera calibration is essential to correct for lens distortion and establish the mathematical relationship between three-dimensional world coordinates and two-dimensional image coordinates.

Force-torque sensors measure interaction forces between the robot and environment, critical for manipulation tasks requiring delicate touch or assembly operations with tight tolerances. Strain gauge-based sensors detect deformation in a mechanical structure under load, while capacitive sensors measure force through changes in capacitance. Six-axis force-torque sensors measure three force components and three torque components, fully characterizing contact wrenches. These sensors enable force control, where the robot regulates applied force rather than position, essential for tasks like polishing, deburring, or compliant assembly.

Sensor fusion combines data from multiple sensors to produce estimates more accurate and reliable than any single sensor. Kalman filtering is a principled probabilistic approach that recursively estimates system state from noisy measurements, weighting sensor contributions based on their uncertainty. The Extended Kalman Filter handles nonlinear sensor models and dynamics. Particle filters represent uncertainty through sets of samples, handling multi-modal distributions and arbitrary noise models. Fusion of complementary sensors, such as combining LIDAR geometry with camera appearance, enables robust perception across diverse conditions.

Applications

Autonomous vehicles integrate LIDAR, cameras, radar, GPS, and IMUs for comprehensive environmental perception. LIDAR provides accurate geometry for obstacle detection and mapping, cameras enable lane detection and traffic sign recognition, radar detects vehicles in adverse weather, GPS provides coarse global localization, and IMUs track orientation and acceleration. Sensor fusion algorithms merge these streams into unified representations supporting perception, prediction, and planning.

Industrial quality inspection systems use vision sensors with structured lighting to detect defects in manufactured parts. High-resolution cameras capture surface details, while laser line scanners measure three-dimensional profiles. Image processing algorithms identify scratches, dents, dimensional deviations, or color variations, enabling automated inspection at speeds and consistency levels exceeding human capability.

Collaborative robots employ force-torque sensors and proximity sensors for safe human interaction. Force sensing enables the robot to detect collisions and immediately stop or retract, preventing injury. Capacitive proximity sensors detect human presence before contact, allowing predictive safety responses. This multi-layered sensing approach enables robots to work alongside humans without safety cages.

Agricultural robots use multispectral cameras to assess crop health, identifying stressed plants through vegetation indices computed from near-infrared and visible light reflectance. LIDAR maps terrain topology for navigation on uneven ground, while RTK-GPS provides centimeter-level positioning accuracy for precise implement control during planting, spraying, or harvesting operations.

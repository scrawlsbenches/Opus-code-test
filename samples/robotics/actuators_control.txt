Robot Actuators and Control Systems

Overview

Actuators are the electromechanical components that convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, serving as the muscles of robotic systems. The selection and control of actuators fundamentally determine robot performance characteristics including speed, precision, force capability, and energy efficiency. Modern robotics employs diverse actuator technologies, each with distinct advantages suited to particular applications, from high-speed pick-and-place operations to delicate surgical procedures.

Control systems regulate actuator behavior to achieve desired motion profiles, reject disturbances, and ensure stability. The control problem involves computing appropriate actuator commands based on sensor feedback and desired trajectory, requiring careful consideration of system dynamics, sensor noise, and computational constraints. Classical control theory provides frameworks like PID control that remain widely used for their simplicity and effectiveness, while advanced techniques like adaptive control and model predictive control address more complex scenarios.

Key Concepts

Electric motors are the predominant actuators in robotics, offering high power density, controllability, and efficiency. DC motors provide straightforward speed control through voltage modulation, with brushed variants being simple and inexpensive, while brushless DC motors eliminate commutator wear and achieve higher speeds and efficiency. Brushless motors require electronic commutation, using rotor position feedback to sequence phase currents, but offer superior performance for precision applications. Stepper motors move in discrete angular increments, enabling open-loop position control without encoders, valuable for positioning systems where precise incremental motion is required. However, steppers can lose steps under excessive load and exhibit resonance at certain speeds.

Servo motors are closed-loop position control systems integrating a motor, encoder, and controller in a single package. Hobby servos use pulse-width modulation for position command, common in small robots and experimental systems, but offer limited precision and torque. Industrial servo motors provide high-performance motion control with advanced features like trajectory generation, electronic gearing, and multi-axis coordination. Servo drives implement current, velocity, and position control loops at high bandwidth, achieving excellent tracking performance and disturbance rejection.

Hydraulic and pneumatic actuators excel in high-force applications. Hydraulic cylinders and motors generate enormous forces and torques from compact packages, making them ideal for heavy manipulation and mobile construction equipment. Hydraulic systems exhibit high stiffness and bandwidth, but require complex auxiliary equipment including pumps, valves, and fluid management. Pneumatic actuators are lighter and simpler but suffer from compressibility effects that limit positioning precision and control bandwidth. Pneumatic grippers are nonetheless popular for pick-and-place operations due to simplicity and safety in the event of air supply loss.

PID control (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) is the workhorse of robot control systems. The proportional term produces control effort proportional to position error, providing basic tracking. The integral term accumulates error over time, eliminating steady-state offset caused by constant disturbances like gravity or friction. The derivative term anticipates error trends, damping oscillations and improving stability. Tuning PID gains balances responsiveness against stability, with numerous tuning methods from Ziegler-Nichols to model-based approaches. Well-tuned PID controllers achieve excellent performance for many robotic systems, particularly when combined with feedforward compensation.

Feedforward control improves tracking performance by computing control inputs based on the desired trajectory rather than reacting to errors. For robot manipulators, feedforward compensation can include gravity compensation, inertial terms, and friction models. Inverse dynamics computes the joint torques required to achieve desired accelerations, velocities, and positions, effectively canceling system dynamics. Combined feedforward-feedback control uses feedforward for nominal trajectory tracking while feedback compensates for model errors and disturbances, achieving performance superior to either approach alone.

Trajectory generation creates smooth reference motions respecting velocity, acceleration, and jerk constraints. Point-to-point trajectories move from one configuration to another using polynomial profiles, with fifth-order polynomials providing continuous acceleration. Trapezoidal velocity profiles maximize travel speed while respecting acceleration limits, accelerating at maximum rate to a constant velocity cruise phase before decelerating to the target. S-curve profiles further smooth motion by limiting jerk, reducing mechanical stress and vibration. For continuous path motion, splines interpolate through waypoints while maintaining specified continuity, critical for applications like CNC machining or spray painting.

Compliance control regulates contact forces rather than purely geometric positioning, essential for manipulation tasks involving contact. Impedance control establishes a virtual mass-spring-damper relationship between force and position, making the robot appear mechanically compliant from the perspective of external forces. Admittance control inverts this relationship, computing position commands from measured forces. Hybrid position-force control simultaneously regulates position in some directions while controlling force in others, necessary for tasks like surface following or peg-in-hole assembly where geometric and force constraints exist in different directions.

Applications

Industrial robotic arms use cascaded control architectures with inner current loops running at kilohertz rates, velocity loops at hundreds of Hertz, and position loops at typical servo rates of 100-1000 Hz. This multi-rate control structure exploits the different dynamics of electrical, mechanical, and kinematic subsystems. Advanced manipulators incorporate feedforward compensation and online trajectory optimization for high-speed operation, critical in electronics assembly where cycle time directly impacts manufacturing cost.

Quadrotor drones implement nested control loops with an inner attitude control loop stabilizing roll, pitch, and yaw using gyroscope feedback, and an outer position control loop using GPS or visual odometry. The attitude controller uses PID or more advanced techniques like sliding mode control to achieve aggressive maneuvers, while the position controller generates attitude commands to achieve desired translations. Gain scheduling adapts controller parameters based on flight regime, maintaining performance across diverse conditions.

Soft robotics employs unconventional actuators including pneumatic artificial muscles, shape memory alloys, and dielectric elastomers to achieve compliant, safe interaction. Control of soft robots presents unique challenges as their dynamics are highly nonlinear and difficult to model accurately. Model-free learning approaches and adaptive control techniques show promise for mastering soft robot manipulation.

Exoskeletons for rehabilitation assist human motion through sophisticated control strategies that detect user intent and provide appropriate assistance. Electromyography sensors measure muscle activation, while force sensors detect interaction torques. Control algorithms must balance assistance level to challenge patients appropriately while ensuring safety, adapting as patient capability improves through therapy sessions. Admittance control naturally accommodates user-initiated deviations from planned trajectories while still providing support.

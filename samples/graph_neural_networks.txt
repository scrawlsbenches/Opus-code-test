Graph neural networks extend deep learning to non-Euclidean data structures.
While convolutional networks assume grid-like topology, graph networks
operate on arbitrary connection patterns. Message passing allows nodes to
aggregate information from neighbors, building representations that capture
graph structure. This paradigm applies to social networks, molecular graphs,
and knowledge bases. PageRank can be viewed as an early form of graph-based
importance propagation, where node centrality emerges from network topology.
Modern graph networks learn to propagate information adaptively, discovering
which connections matter for each task. The brain itself is a graph of
neurons, making these architectures particularly relevant for neuroscience
applications.

# Knowledge Representation and Ontologies

## Introduction

Knowledge representation (KR) is the field concerned with how to formally encode information about the world so that computer systems can reason about it. Ontologies provide structured vocabularies and relationships that enable knowledge sharing and interoperability.

## Representation Formalisms

### Semantic Networks

Graph structures where:
- Nodes represent concepts or instances
- Edges represent relationships

**Types of Links:**
- IS-A: Class hierarchy (Dog IS-A Mammal)
- PART-OF: Composition (Engine PART-OF Car)
- HAS-PROPERTY: Attributes (Apple HAS-COLOR Red)
- Arbitrary relations: (John OWNS House)

**Inheritance:**
Properties propagate down IS-A hierarchy.
Dog IS-A Mammal → Dogs inherit mammal properties

**Limitations:**
- Informal semantics
- Ambiguous interpretation
- No standard inference

### Frame Systems

Structured knowledge packages:

```
Frame: Dog
  Superclass: Mammal
  Slots:
    legs:
      type: integer
      default: 4
    size:
      type: {small, medium, large}
    owner:
      type: Person
      cardinality: 0..1
  Methods:
    bark(): Sound
```

**Features:**
- Default values
- Procedural attachments (demons)
- Multiple inheritance (with resolution strategies)
- Facets (constraints, documentation)

**Relation to Object-Oriented:**
Frames influenced OOP; classes are similar but typically lack default reasoning.

### Description Logics

Formal, decidable subset of first-order logic.

**Syntax:**
- Concepts (unary predicates): Human, Parent
- Roles (binary relations): hasChild, worksFor
- Individuals: john, mary

**Constructors:**
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⊤ | Top (everything) |
| ⊥ | Bottom (nothing) |
| ¬C | Negation |
| C ⊓ D | Intersection |
| C ⊔ D | Union |
| ∀R.C | Value restriction |
| ∃R.C | Existential restriction |
| ≥n R | Cardinality restriction |

**Example:**
```
Parent ≡ Person ⊓ ∃hasChild.Person
Father ≡ Parent ⊓ Male
GoodParent ≡ Parent ⊓ ∀hasChild.(Happy ⊓ Healthy)
```

**Reasoning Services:**
- Subsumption: Is C subclass of D?
- Consistency: Can concept have instances?
- Classification: Place concept in hierarchy
- Realization: Find most specific concepts for individual

### First-Order Logic

Full predicate logic with quantifiers.

**Expressiveness:**
- Universal quantification: ∀x
- Existential quantification: ∃x
- Functions and predicates

**Example:**
```
∀x.(Parent(x) → ∃y.(Child(y) ∧ hasChild(x,y)))
∀x.∀y.(hasParent(x,y) ↔ hasChild(y,x))
```

**Limitations:**
- Undecidable in general
- Computationally intractable
- Difficult to use practically

## Ontology Engineering

### Definition

An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization.

- **Formal:** Machine-readable
- **Explicit:** Clearly defined
- **Shared:** Community consensus
- **Conceptualization:** Abstract model

### Components

**Classes (Concepts):**
Categories of things (Person, Vehicle, Event)

**Properties (Relations):**
- Object properties: Link individuals (hasAuthor)
- Datatype properties: Link to values (hasAge → integer)

**Individuals (Instances):**
Specific entities (John_Smith, Toyota_Camry_2020)

**Axioms:**
Logical statements constraining the model

### OWL (Web Ontology Language)

W3C standard built on description logics.

**Sublanguages:**
- **OWL Lite:** Simple constraints
- **OWL DL:** Maximum expressiveness with decidability
- **OWL Full:** No restrictions, undecidable

**Key Features:**
- Class definitions (equivalent, disjoint)
- Property characteristics (transitive, symmetric, functional)
- Cardinality constraints
- Enumerated classes (oneOf)

**Example (Turtle syntax):**
```
:Person a owl:Class .
:hasSpouse a owl:ObjectProperty, owl:SymmetricProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Person ;
    rdfs:range :Person .
:MarriedPerson owl:equivalentClass [
    a owl:Restriction ;
    owl:onProperty :hasSpouse ;
    owl:someValuesFrom :Person
] .
```

### Development Methodologies

**METHONTOLOGY:**
1. Specification
2. Conceptualization
3. Formalization
4. Implementation
5. Maintenance

**NeOn Methodology:**
Scenario-based approach for networked ontologies

**Competency Questions:**
Define what the ontology should answer:
- "What medications interact with drug X?"
- "Who are the authors of papers in domain Y?"

### Design Principles

**Clarity:** Definitions effectively communicate meaning

**Coherence:** Inferences consistent with definitions

**Extendibility:** Can add concepts without revision

**Minimal Encoding Bias:** Don't assume particular encoding

**Minimal Ontological Commitment:** Make minimal assumptions

## Upper Ontologies

Domain-independent top-level categories.

### Examples

**DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering):**
- Endurants (objects)
- Perdurants (events)
- Qualities
- Abstracts

**BFO (Basic Formal Ontology):**
- Continuants (independent, dependent)
- Occurrents (processes, temporal regions)
- Used in biomedical ontologies

**SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology):**
- Physical, abstract, process
- Maps to WordNet synsets

### Benefits

- Interoperability across domains
- Consistent foundational concepts
- Guide domain ontology development

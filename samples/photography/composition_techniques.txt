# Photography Composition: Visual Design Principles

## Introduction

Composition—the arrangement of visual elements within the frame—transforms snapshots into compelling images. While technical exposure captures light, composition captures attention and communicates meaning.

## Fundamental Principles

### Rule of Thirds

Divide frame into nine equal parts with two horizontal and two vertical lines. Place key elements along lines or at intersections (power points).

**Applications:**
- Horizon on upper or lower third, not center
- Subject's eyes at upper intersection
- Leading elements at lower third entering frame

**When to Break:**
- Symmetrical subjects (reflections, architecture)
- Emphasizing isolation or confrontation (center)
- Dynamic tension through unconventional placement

### Golden Ratio

Phi (φ ≈ 1.618) creates naturally pleasing proportions.

**Golden Spiral:**
Logarithmic spiral guides eye from outside to focal point.

**Golden Triangles:**
Diagonal across frame with perpendiculars creating triangular areas.

**Application:**
Place key elements where spiral tightens or along triangle divisions.

### Visual Weight and Balance

Elements have "weight" based on:
- Size: Larger = heavier
- Color: Bright/warm = heavier than muted/cool
- Contrast: High contrast = heavier
- Complexity: Detailed = heavier
- Position: Elements at edges feel heavier

**Balance Types:**
- Symmetrical: Equal weight both sides
- Asymmetrical: Different elements balancing
- Radial: Elements around central point

### Figure-Ground Relationship

Distinct separation between subject (figure) and background (ground).

**Techniques:**
- Tonal contrast
- Color contrast
- Depth of field separation
- Framing
- Light/shadow

## Leading Lines

Lines direct viewer's eye through the image.

**Types:**
- Straight: Roads, fences, architecture
- Curved: Rivers, paths, S-curves
- Diagonal: Dynamic energy, tension
- Converging: Depth, perspective

**Best Practices:**
- Lead TO subject, not away from frame
- Enter from corners for maximum effect
- Avoid leading to empty space or frame edge

### Implied Lines

Suggested rather than physical:
- Eye direction (where subject looks)
- Motion direction
- Gesture and body language
- Alignment of multiple elements

## Framing

Use scene elements to create frame within frame.

**Natural Frames:**
- Windows and doorways
- Arches and tunnels
- Tree branches
- Overhangs

**Benefits:**
- Creates depth layers
- Focuses attention
- Provides context
- Adds visual interest

**Considerations:**
- Frame should complement, not compete
- Consistent with subject mood
- Proper exposure for both frame and subject

## Depth and Layers

Create three-dimensional feeling in two-dimensional image.

### Foreground Interest

Include compelling foreground element:
- Anchors composition
- Creates depth
- Provides scale
- Adds storytelling element

### Layered Composition

**Three-Layer Structure:**
1. Foreground: Entry point, context
2. Middle ground: Main subject
3. Background: Environment, atmosphere

### Depth Cues

- Size diminution (smaller = farther)
- Overlap (obscured = behind)
- Atmospheric perspective (haze = distance)
- Linear perspective (convergence)
- Texture gradient (detail decreases with distance)

## Patterns and Repetition

### Pattern Photography

Regular repetition creates visual rhythm:
- Architecture: Windows, bricks, tiles
- Nature: Leaves, waves, scales
- Urban: Crowds, products, vehicles

### Breaking Patterns

Interruption creates focal point:
- Color difference
- Size anomaly
- Direction change
- Missing element

## Negative Space

Empty area around subject.

**Functions:**
- Emphasizes subject
- Creates mood (isolation, tranquility)
- Provides breathing room
- Simplifies composition

**Guidelines:**
- More negative space = greater emphasis
- Direction of negative space matters (subject "looking into" space)
- High key (white) vs. low key (black) effects

## Symmetry and Asymmetry

### Symmetry

Mirror-like balance creates:
- Harmony and calm
- Formal, structured feeling
- Emphasis on pattern

**Types:**
- Vertical: Left-right reflection
- Horizontal: Top-bottom reflection
- Radial: Around central point

### Asymmetry

Deliberate imbalance creates:
- Dynamic tension
- Visual interest
- Natural, organic feeling

## Color Composition

### Color Relationships

**Complementary:** Opposite on color wheel (high contrast)
**Analogous:** Adjacent colors (harmony)
**Triadic:** Three evenly spaced (vibrant)
**Monochromatic:** Single hue variations (unity)

### Color Effects

- Warm colors advance; cool colors recede
- Saturated colors attract attention
- Color isolation draws the eye
- Color temperature affects mood

## Simplification

### Remove Distractions

- Change angle to eliminate background clutter
- Move closer to exclude unnecessary elements
- Use depth of field to blur distractions
- Wait for people to leave frame

### One Clear Subject

Every strong image answers: "What is this photo of?"

**Test:** Can you describe the subject in one sentence?

## Perspective

### Height Variations

**Eye Level:** Neutral, relatable
**Low Angle:** Power, monumentality
**High Angle:** Overview, vulnerability
**Ground Level:** Intimate, unique view

### Distance Variations

**Wide:** Context, environment
**Medium:** Standard view
**Tight:** Detail, emotion, isolation

## Advanced Techniques

### Juxtaposition

Meaningful contrast between elements:
- Old/new
- Large/small
- Natural/artificial
- Static/dynamic

### Visual Tension

Deliberately uncomfortable elements:
- Off-center subjects
- Partial frames (cropping subject)
- Tilted horizons (Dutch angle)
- Extreme negative space

### Gestalt Principles

- Proximity: Close elements group
- Similarity: Like elements relate
- Continuity: Eye follows lines
- Closure: Mind completes incomplete forms

## Developing Your Eye

1. Study great photographs and paintings
2. Shoot more, edit ruthlessly
3. Review and critique own work
4. Practice with constraints (one lens, one subject)
5. Sketch compositions before shooting

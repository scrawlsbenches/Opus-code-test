After TF-IDF computation - save partial state\n2. After bigram connections - save partial state  \n3. After PageRank - save partial state\n4. After concepts - save partial state\n5. After semantics - final save\n\nBenefits:\n- Resume from checkpoint if session times out\n- Progress visibility (which phase are we on)\n- Partial results usable even if later phases fail\n\nImplementation:\n- Add checkpoint_dir parameter to compute_all()\n- Save phase completions as JSON markers\n- Add resume_from_checkpoint() method",

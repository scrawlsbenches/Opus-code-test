      "description": "Sprint 4: Implement hierarchical loop execution with step-based approach (not coroutines). Key features: 1) Priority queue execution with adjustable time budgets 2) Parent control over child loops (pause/resume/terminate) 3) Hierarchical time allocation (children get fraction of parent budget) 4) State machine for yielding/resuming at checkpoints 5) Proper propagation of results up the hierarchy. See discussion in session about avoiding coroutine complexity.",

Consider: 1) File-based message passing (simple, git-friendly) 2) Shared state file that agents can read/update 3) Dependency signals (agent B waits for signal from agent A) 4) Progress updates visible to coordinator 5) Emergency stop propagation. IMPORTANT: Only implement if proven necessary - current boundary-based isolation worked for 8 parallel agents in Sprints 1-3.",

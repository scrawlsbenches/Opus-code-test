Run balance analyzer to measure improvement: `python scripts/analyze_corpus_balance.py`\n2. Continue adding documents to low-coverage domains (5-14 docs)\n3. Target domains still needing content: medicine_clinical, robotics, agriculture, physics_quantum, biology_ecology\n4. Re-index corpus and verify PageRank improvement\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Balance score > 0.7\n- 80+ domains with 25+ docs each\n- PageRank top 20 shows domain terms, not code artifacts\n- Concept clusters align with knowledge domains",

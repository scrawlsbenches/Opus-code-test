      "description": "## Context\nBuilding a balanced corpus capable of training ~100 specialized micro-models for a Mixture of Experts (MoE) system.\n\n## Current State (as of 2025-12-17)\n- Total samples: 237 documents\n- Domains covered: 84/100\n- Balance score: 0.364 (target: >0.7)\n- Gap: ~2,500 documents needed\n\n## What Works\nParallel sub-agents can generate high-quality domain content:\n- 5 agents ran in parallel, each generating 5 docs\n- Produced authentic content with real terminology, citations, formulas\n- Domains added: philosophy, civil_engineering, criminal_law, robotics, archaeology\n\n## Key Files\n- docs/corpus-balancing-plan.md - Full strategy document\n- scripts/analyze_corpus_balance.py - Balance analyzer\n- scripts/generate_sample_docs.py - Template generator (low quality, use agents instead)\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Run balance analyzer to identify critical gaps: `python scripts/analyze_corpus_balance.py`\n2. Launch parallel agents for each gap domain (5 docs each)\n3. Commit and push in batches\n4. Re-index and re-run repo_showcase.py to verify improvement\n5. Target: PageRank top 20 should show domain diversity, not just \"assert, test, processor\"\n\n## Scaling Strategy\n- 20 parallel agents \u00d7 5 docs = 100 docs per batch\n- ~25 batches to reach 2,500 docs\n- Priority domains (0 docs): chemical_engineering, biomedical_engineering, computer_vision, \n  operations_management, religious_studies, art_history, photography, woodworking, team_sports, etc.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Balance score > 0.7\n- 80+ domains with 25+ docs each\n- PageRank top 20 shows domain terms, not code artifacts\n- Concept clusters align with knowledge domains",

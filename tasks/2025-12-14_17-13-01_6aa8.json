The search seems to weight common terms like 'test' too heavily.\n\nInvestigation areas:\n- Query expansion may be pulling in too many generic terms\n- TF-IDF weighting may not properly discount common programming terms\n- Domain-specific boosting could improve relevance for security/testing queries\n\nRelated: The code_concepts.py has programming synonyms but may need security-specific terms.\n\nDiscovered during: Dog-fooding session 2025-12-14",

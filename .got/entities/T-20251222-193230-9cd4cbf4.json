    "description": "## Problem\nGoT state changes (task completions, edge creation) can be lost if not committed to git.\n\n## Proposal\nAuto-commit .got/ directory changes after significant operations:\n- Task completion\n- Decision logging\n- Edge creation\n- Sprint state changes\n\n## Safety Verification Needed\n1. Is .got/ always safe to auto-commit? (Yes - it's our data, not code)\n2. Could auto-commits conflict with manual commits? (Use separate commit messages)\n3. Should auto-commits be squashable? (Yes - use consistent prefix)\n4. What about branch conflicts? (GoT files use unique IDs, should merge cleanly)\n\n## Implementation\n1. Add post-operation hook in GoTManager\n2. Use git add .got/ && git commit -m \"chore(got): Auto-save state\"\n3. Make configurable (enable/disable via env var or config)\n4. Consider batching commits (every N operations or time-based)\n\n## Recommendation\nSafe to implement - GoT uses entity files with unique IDs, designed for merge-friendly operation.",

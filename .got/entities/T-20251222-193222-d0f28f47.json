    "description": "## Problem\nSub-agents report success but file changes don't persist to the main agent's filesystem.\n\n## Evidence from 2025-12-22 session (QkbsL)\n1. Implementation agent reported adding JUSTIFIES/PART_OF to EdgeType enum\n2. Agent showed verification output proving changes worked\n3. But `git status` showed no changes to the file\n4. Main agent had to manually apply the same changes\n\n## Investigation Tasks\n1. Understand how Task tool spawns sub-agents and their filesystem context\n2. Determine if sub-agents share the same filesystem or work in isolation\n3. Test with explicit file verification after sub-agent completion\n4. Check if there's a flush/sync issue with file writes\n\n## Possible Solutions\n- Require sub-agents to commit changes before returning\n- Have main agent always verify file state after sub-agent work\n- Store diffs in task metadata for recovery",

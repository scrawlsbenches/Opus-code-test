    "description": "## Problem\nNo guidance in CLAUDE.md for reliable sub-agent delegation patterns.\n\n## Proposed Additions\n1. Sub-agent verification protocol (always verify file changes persisted)\n2. When to use sub-agents vs direct work\n3. Language patterns for clear delegation\n4. Recovery procedures when sub-agent changes don't persist\n5. Director pattern documentation with parallel execution\n\n## Key Points to Document\n- Sub-agents may work in isolated contexts\n- Always verify state changes after sub-agent returns\n- Don't trust success reports for critical state changes\n- Use explicit file paths and line numbers in delegation\n- Consider storing diffs for recovery",

Plus 2 other TODO/HACK comments found during audit\n\nAction needed:\n- Review each comment to determine if still relevant\n- Remove comments that are no longer valid\n- Update comments that need correction\n- Create follow-up tasks if TODOs need implementation\n\nThis was deferred from Stage 4 of the codebase cleanup audit.",

    "description": "Research and implement a Code Evolution Model that learns from git history to predict and understand how codebases change over time.\n\n## Research Questions\n1. Can temporal code relationships predict change impact better than static analysis?\n2. What diff tokenization strategies preserve semantic meaning?\n3. How can commit message intent improve file prediction accuracy?\n4. Can we learn refactoring patterns from historical transformations?\n\n## Core Components to Investigate\n1. **Diff Tokenizer** - Intelligent tokenization of git diffs (additions/deletions/context)\n2. **Co-change Model** - Learn which files change together over time\n3. **Intent Parser** - Extract intent from commit messages (fix, feat, refactor, etc.)\n4. **Temporal Call Graph** - Augment static call graph with historical co-change data\n5. **Change Predictor** - Given current changes, predict what else needs modification\n\n## Integration Points\n- SparkCodeIntelligence (AST + N-gram hybrid)\n- ML File Prediction (existing commit-based model)\n- CorticalTextProcessor (semantic understanding)\n- GoT Task System (for tracking predicted vs actual changes)\n\n## Evaluation Metrics\n- Prediction accuracy: predicted files vs actual changed files\n- Recall@K: are the right files in top K suggestions?\n- Temporal precision: does recency weighting improve results?\n- Comparison vs static-only analysis\n\n## Paper Outline\n1. Introduction - The gap between static analysis and real change patterns\n2. Related Work - Change impact analysis, MSR, code evolution studies\n3. Methodology - Architecture, training process, evaluation setup\n4. Implementation - SparkSLM integration, git mining pipeline\n5. Evaluation - Experiments on real repositories\n6. Discussion - Insights, limitations, future work\n7. Conclusion",

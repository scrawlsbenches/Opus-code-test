Why do sprint IDs collide across branches?\n2. Why can the same ID represent different semantic entities?\n3. How do parallel agents/branches create conflicting state?\n4. What makes tasks (T-*) more merge-friendly than sprints (S-*)?\n\n### Deliverables\n- Document detailing each root cause\n- Comparison of task ID generation vs sprint ID generation\n- Diagram of how the conflict arose\n- Recommendations for investigation tasks", "entity_type": "task", "id": "T-20251226-114231-675e2be0", "metadata": {}, "modified_at": "2025-12-26T11:42:31.350225+00:00", "priority": "high", "properties": {}, "status": "pending", "title": "Analyze GoT merge conflict root causes from Dec 2025 audit", "version": 2}, "global_version": 1200, "timestamp": "2025-12-26T13:07:00.275533+00:00"}

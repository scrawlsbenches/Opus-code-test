Options: (1) Use timestamp instead of incrementing counter - last-write-wins, (2) Add .gitattributes merge strategy to always take higher version, (3) Remove version file and derive from file count/checksums, (4) Use branch-aware versioning. Triggered by merge conflict in session QkbsL (version 160 vs 138).",

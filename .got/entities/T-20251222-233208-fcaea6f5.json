    "description": "Explore training SparkCodeIntelligence on git history to learn code evolution patterns. Potential approaches:\n1. Train on commit diffs to learn change patterns (what changes together)\n2. Use commit messages + changed files to predict future changes\n3. Learn refactoring patterns from historical code transformations\n4. Integrate with ML file prediction for temporal awareness\n5. Build a 'code evolution' model that understands how codebase grows\n\nKey questions:\n- How to tokenize diffs intelligently (additions/deletions/context)?\n- Should we weight recent commits more heavily?\n- Can we learn from commit message \u2192 file mapping?\n- Integration with existing call graph for impact prediction?",

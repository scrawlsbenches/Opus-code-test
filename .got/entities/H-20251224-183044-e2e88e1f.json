    "instructions": "## Handoff: Orphan Rate Fix - Verification Required\n\n### What Was Done\nReduced GoT orphan rate from 51.4% to 17.6% by linking 25 completed orphan tasks to S-018.\n\n### Changes Made\n1. **25 CONTAINS edges created** linking completed tasks to S-018 (Schema Evolution Foundation)\n2. **Decision logged**: D-20251224-182349-bb7daed6\n3. **Knowledge transfer**: `samples/memories/2025-12-24-session-knowledge-transfer-orphan-rate-fix.md`\n\n### Verification Steps for Next Agent\n\n1. **Confirm GoT validation passes**:\n   ```bash\n   python scripts/got_utils.py validate\n   ```\n   Expected: `\u2705 HEALTHY - No issues detected`\n\n2. **Confirm orphan rate is ~17.6%**:\n   ```bash\n   python scripts/got_utils.py orphan report\n   ```\n   Expected: 7 orphan tasks (all pending backlog items)\n\n3. **Confirm edge count increased**:\n   ```bash\n   python scripts/got_utils.py dashboard | head -20\n   ```\n   Expected: ~88 edges, edge density ~1.19\n\n4. **Code review the knowledge transfer doc**:\n   - File: `samples/memories/2025-12-24-session-knowledge-transfer-orphan-rate-fix.md`\n   - Verify accuracy and completeness\n\n5. **Run smoke tests**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/smoke/ -v\n   ```\n\n### Key Files\n- `.got/entities/E-S-018-T-*.json` - New CONTAINS edges\n- `.got/entities/D-20251224-182349-bb7daed6.json` - Decision record\n- `samples/memories/2025-12-24-session-knowledge-transfer-orphan-rate-fix.md` - Documentation\n\n### If Verification Fails\nIf orphan rate is back to 51.4% or edges are missing, the auto-commit/auto-push may have failed. Re-run:\n```bash\npython scripts/got_utils.py orphan auto-link --sprint S-018 --task-ids <completed-orphan-ids>\n```",

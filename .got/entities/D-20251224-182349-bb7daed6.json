    "rationale": "Orphan rate was at 51.4% (38 orphans) causing validation warnings. Root cause: tasks completed during migration period were never linked to sprints. Fix: auto-linked 25 completed orphans to S-018 (Schema Evolution Foundation) sprint. Remaining 7 orphans are legitimate backlog items (pending IDEA/design/test tasks). Result: orphan rate reduced to 17.6% (13 orphans), validation now passes healthy.",

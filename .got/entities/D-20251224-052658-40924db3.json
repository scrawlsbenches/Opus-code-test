GoTBackendFactory.create() now ONLY returns TransactionalGoTAdapter\n2. But `infer_edges_from_commit()` and `infer_edges_from_recent_commits()` exist ONLY in GoTProjectManager (lines 3732-3853)\n3. CLI module cortical/got/cli/query.py:237 calls these methods on manager\n4. Result: Runtime AttributeError\n\n### Methods Missing from TransactionalGoTAdapter\n- infer_edges_from_commit(commit_message, files_changed) -> List[Dict]\n- infer_edges_from_recent_commits(count) -> List[Dict]\n\n### Implication\nTask T-20251222-145525-445df343 is PREMATURE. The claim that \"TX backend replaces all functionality\" is FALSE.\n\n### Required Before Any Deletion\n1. Port missing methods to TransactionalGoTAdapter\n2. Add integration tests for ALL CLI commands\n3. Verify no other gaps exist\n4. Only then consider deletion\n\n### Lesson Learned\nPrevious agents' decisions must be verified empirically, not trusted blindly. This gap existed because the decision was made without testing the `infer` command.",

    "description": "## Goal (WHY)\nBefore building domain transfer, understand current analogy capabilities and identify what's missing.\n\n## Exploration Questions\n1. How does complete_analogy() currently work?\n2. What is a \"domain\" in the context of this codebase?\n3. How could we represent structural mappings between domains?\n4. What existing data structures could support domain transfer?\n\n## Files to Read\n- cortical/query/analogy.py (full file)\n- cortical/reasoning/prism_pln.py (for probabilistic domain links)\n- cortical/reasoning/thought_graph.py (for graph structures)\n- tests/unit/test_query_analogy.py (understand current tests)\n\n## Deliverables\nReport with:\n1. Current analogy capabilities and limitations\n2. Proposed Domain and StructuralMapping data structures\n3. How to represent \"water flows downhill\" maps to \"electricity flows through least resistance\"\n4. Integration strategy with existing code\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n- Do NOT write code - exploration only\n- Do NOT assume structure - read the actual code\n\n## Reference: docs/epic-cognitive-nlu-nlg-knowledge-base.md\n## GoT: Check Sprint 1 tasks for patterns",

Current issues: 1) Tests create real GoT data but don't properly clean up or mock, 2) Unit tests pass but behavioral tests fail, 3) Need to convert to mocked unit tests with mock_manager fixtures instead of real got_manager. Key areas needing coverage: got/api.py (72%), got/protocol.py (53%), got/wal.py (84%), got/sync.py (84%). Follow the TDD pattern: behavioral tests use got_manager (real data), unit tests use mock_manager (no cleanup needed)."}}

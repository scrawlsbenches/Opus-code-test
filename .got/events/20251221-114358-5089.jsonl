Risk: parallel agents could corrupt graph state. \n\nCURRENT STATE:\n- File writes: SAFE (atomic_append)\n- Event log: SAFE (append-only, unique session files)\n- In-memory graph: UNSAFE (no locks)\n\nMITIGATION NEEDED:\n1. Add threading.RLock to GoTProjectManager\n2. Wrap all graph mutations in lock context\n3. Document thread safety guarantees\n\nWORKAROUND (current): Sub-agents run as separate processes with own memory. Risk is low but not zero."}}

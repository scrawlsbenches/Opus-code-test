Bonsai cultivation miniaturizes trees through container restriction, pruning,
and wiring techniques developed over centuries in Japan and China. Species
selection matches climate conditions—junipers and pines tolerate outdoor
temperate winters while tropical ficuses require indoor protection. Deciduous
maples display seasonal foliage changes prized for autumn color.

Styling follows classical forms: formal upright chokkan, informal upright
moyogi, slanting shakan, cascade kengai, and windswept fukinagashi among
dozens of recognized shapes. Nebari root flare establishes visual stability
at soil surface. Trunk taper and movement convey age while branch ramification
creates fine twiggy structure mimicking mature trees.

Wiring wraps anodized aluminum or copper around branches, bending them
into position over months before removal prevents scarring. Pinching new
candles on pines controls internode length. Defoliation on healthy deciduous
specimens triggers smaller secondary leaves. Repotting rejuvenates root
systems every two to five years depending on species vigor. Akadama clay
provides optimal drainage and aeration, often mixed with pumice and lava rock.

Astronomical spectroscopy reveals stellar composition, temperature, and
velocity by analyzing electromagnetic radiation absorption and emission patterns.
Stellar atmospheres imprint characteristic absorption lines as photons
traverse cooler outer layers. Fraunhofer lines in solar spectrum identify
hydrogen, calcium, sodium, and iron among dozens of detectable elements.

Spectral classification categorizes stars by surface temperature from hottest
O-type blue giants through B, A, F, G, K to coolest M-type red dwarfs.
Luminosity classes distinguish main sequence dwarfs, subgiants, giants, and
supergiants sharing similar temperatures but vastly different radii. Hertzsprung-
Russell diagrams plot these relationships, revealing stellar evolution pathways.

Doppler shifts measure radial velocities: blueshifted lines indicate approach,
redshifted lines recession. Exoplanet detection exploits stellar wobble
inducing periodic velocity variations. Echelle spectrographs achieve
resolutions exceeding R=100,000, resolving rotational broadening and
distinguishing isotope ratios. Integral field units capture spatially resolved
spectra across extended objects simultaneously, mapping galaxy kinematics
and nebular ionization structures.

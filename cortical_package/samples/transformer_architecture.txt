The transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern natural
language processing. Unlike recurrent networks that process sequences
step by step, transformers use self-attention mechanisms to relate all
positions in a sequence simultaneously. This parallel processing enables
efficient training on massive datasets. The attention mechanism computes
weighted combinations of input representations, allowing the model to
focus on relevant context regardless of distance. Large language models
built on transformers demonstrate emergent capabilities including reasoning,
translation, and code generation. Some researchers see parallels between
attention mechanisms and how the brain selectively processes information,
though the biological analogy remains debated.

Medieval falconry distinguished nobility through mastery of raptors trained
for hunting quarry. Austringers worked with goshawks and sparrowhawks while
falconers flew peregrines, sakers, and gyrfalcons at herons and waterfowl.
The mews housed birds between hunts, with perches, baths, and weathering yards
for conditioning.

Manning wild-caught birds required patience as the austringer gradually
habituated raptors to human presence. Bating, the panicked flapping when
startled, decreased as trust developed. Jesses attached to leather anklets
tethered birds to the gloved fist, while bells and bewits aided tracking.
The creance line allowed controlled free-flight practice before releasing
birds unrestrained.

Falconers assessed birds' condition by feeling the keel bone prominence,
adjusting rations to maintain flying weight without weakness. Casting pellets
of undigested fur and bone indicated healthy digestion. Imping replaced
damaged flight feathers by splicing donor feathers with needles. Hooding
calmed excitable birds, while lures trained them to return when stooping
failed to secure prey.

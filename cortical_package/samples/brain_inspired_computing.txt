Brain-inspired computing seeks to build artificial systems that capture the
computational principles of biological neural networks. The human brain
processes information using billions of neurons connected by trillions of
synapses, achieving remarkable efficiency through sparse distributed
representations. Unlike conventional computers that separate memory and
processing, the brain integrates computation and storage in the same
physical substrate. Neuromorphic chips attempt to replicate this architecture
using analog circuits that mimic synaptic plasticity. These systems excel at
pattern recognition tasks while consuming far less power than traditional
processors. The challenge remains bridging the gap between biological
complexity and engineering feasibility.

Knowledge graphs represent information as networks of entities connected by typed relationships. Unlike relational databases that store data in rigid tables, knowledge graphs embrace the flexible, interconnected nature of real-world knowledge. Each node represents an entity or concept, while edges encode specific relationships between them.

The structure of knowledge graphs mirrors how humans organize knowledge through associations. When we think of Paris, we naturally connect it to France, the Eiffel Tower, romance, and croissants. Knowledge graphs capture these multidimensional relationships explicitly, enabling machines to traverse semantic connections.

Graph databases like Neo4j and ArangoDB provide native storage for knowledge graphs, optimizing for relationship traversal rather than table joins. Query languages such as SPARQL and Cypher allow complex pattern matching across the graph structure. These enable questions like "find all scientists who studied at universities in Germany and later worked at American companies."

Major technology companies have built massive knowledge graphs to power their products. Google's Knowledge Graph enhances search results with structured information panels. Facebook's social graph connects billions of users through relationships. Amazon's product graph links items through categories, attributes, and purchase patterns.

Building knowledge graphs requires both structured data extraction and natural language processing. Named entity recognition identifies concepts in text. Relation extraction discovers connections between entities. Entity resolution merges duplicate references to the same real-world object. These techniques transform unstructured text into structured knowledge.

The semantic web vision proposed by Tim Berners-Lee imagined a web of machine-readable data. Standards like RDF and OWL provide formal languages for knowledge representation. While the full semantic web vision remains unrealized, knowledge graphs have become essential infrastructure for artificial intelligence applications.

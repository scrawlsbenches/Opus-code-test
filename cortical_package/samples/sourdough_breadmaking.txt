Sourdough breadmaking relies on wild yeast fermentation and lactobacillus
bacteria cultures maintained in a starter. The levain develops complex flavors
through extended fermentation as microorganisms consume flour sugars and produce
carbon dioxide, ethanol, and organic acids. Bakers refresh their starters daily,
discarding portions and feeding fresh flour and water to maintain vigor.

Autolyse allows gluten development before mixing by hydrating flour without
salt. Stretch-and-fold techniques build dough strength during bulk fermentation,
which typically lasts four to six hours at room temperature. The windowpane test
confirms adequate gluten development when dough stretches thin without tearing.

Proofing in bannetons shapes loaves while the final rise develops. Scoring the
dough surface with a lame controls oven spring expansion. Steam injection during
initial baking gelatinizes surface starches, creating glossy, crackly crust.
Internal crumb structure reveals open, irregular alveoli when fermentation and
shaping succeed. Tartine-style loaves achieve ear formation through proper
scoring angles and aggressive oven heat.

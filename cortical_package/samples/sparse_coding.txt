Sparse coding is a fundamental principle of neural information processing.
At any moment, only a small percentage of neurons are active, yet this
sparse pattern can represent vast amounts of information through combinatorics.
The visual cortex uses sparse distributed representations where each neuron
responds to specific features and each object activates a unique sparse
pattern. This encoding scheme offers several advantages: energy efficiency,
noise robustness, and the ability to store many overlapping memories without
interference. Artificial neural networks are beginning to incorporate
sparsity constraints, leading to more efficient and interpretable models.
Sparse autoencoders, for instance, learn compressed representations by
penalizing excessive activation.

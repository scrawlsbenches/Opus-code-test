  "query": "How can we integrate this model into our codebase, do we have any value to add considering what .AI_meta files do or could do, what are we thinking of that should be considered that hasn't been considered, what value can we offer developers that would be interested in a project like ours, should we update our README.md to better showcase our codebase and consider making our README.md better setup for who might read/use it?",
  "response": "Great strategic questions! Let me explore these systematically: I'll research the `.ai_meta` file system for you. Let me start by finding and examining these files.",

  "query": "Ok, thanks for the update.\nAdd system warnings to model, it sounds like an important feature of a model like this or do you think it's outside the scope of our model and could get annoying, what are your thoughts?\nShould we save models generated over time so that we can compare models to each other over time with models from the past to learn or relearn as needs change, it could be interesting to update to a specific branch and ask a models from the past what are the differences are between the current/future models, what are your thoughts, I'd like to dog food this idea?",
  "response": "Both ideas are excellent and align well with the project's transparency philosophy. Let me share my thoughts:\n\n## System Warnings\n\n**Strongly recommend.** This fits perfectly with the \"explainable IR\" ethos. Warnings should include:\n\n| Warning Type | Trigger | Value |\n|-------------|---------|-------|\n| Low confidence | All scores < 0.5 | Prevents false trust in weak predictions |\n| Stale model | Model > 10 commits behind HEAD | Reminds to retrain |\n| No keyword match | Query has no MODULE_KEYWORDS hits | Explains sparse results |\n| Missing files | Predicted files don't exist | Catches post-refactor issues |\n| Small training set | < 50 commits | Sets expectations |\n\n## Model Versioning\n\n**Very interesting for dog-fooding.** We could:\n- Snapshot models with git commit hash\n- Compare predictions across versions\n- Track metrics (MRR, recall) over time\n- Ask \"what would the Dec 1st model predict?\"\n\nLet me implement both features:",

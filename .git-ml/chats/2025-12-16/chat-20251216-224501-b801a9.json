  "query": "Great questions, I think we need to handle three potential runs: automatic, semi auto, and surveyed manual that fills in the parameters.\nI think we should use a lock file but be able to override it as well as any of the other questions, we should fill them in with intelligent defaults and let the runner decide if they need to change anything at runtime, if that works for you please proceed with script creation or tell me your thoughts.",
  "response": "That works well. Let me create a comprehensive script with those three modes and intelligent defaults.",

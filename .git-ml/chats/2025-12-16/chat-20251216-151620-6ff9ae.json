  "response": "You're welcome! The session has resumed with the consolidated `session_logger.py` changes in place.\n\nBased on my Director review, the recommended next priorities are:\n\n1. **T-003 (16f3) - Fix session capture** - The real blocker (2% vs 113% commits)\n2. **T-013 - Remove protobuf** - Quick cleanup, decision already made\n3. **Top 3 T-014 performance fixes** - Cache `count_data()`, merge scans, limit O(n²) pairs\n\nWould you like to tackle any of these, or is there something else you'd like to work on?",

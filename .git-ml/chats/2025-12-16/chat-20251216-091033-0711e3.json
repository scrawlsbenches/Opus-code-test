  "response": "## Suggestions to Improve the ML File Prediction Model\n\n### 1. **Filter Out Deleted/Renamed Files**\n```python\n# Add file existence check before predictions\npredicted = [f for f in predicted_files if os.path.exists(f)]\n```\nThis would prevent suggesting `TASK_LIST.md` or old `cortical/processor.py` (now a package).\n\n### 2. **Add File Co-occurrence Weighting**\nCurrently the model knows files changed together historically. Could strengthen this with:\n- **Recency weighting** - recent commits matter more than old ones\n- **Decay factor** - files deleted 50+ commits ago get downweighted\n\n### 3. **Incorporate Codebase Structure**\n```python\n# If predicting cortical/query/expansion.py, also suggest:\n# - cortical/query/__init__.py (same package)\n# - tests/unit/test_query_expansion.py (test file pattern)\n```\n\n### 4. **Semantic Similarity via Cortical Processor**\nUse the library itself to improve predictions:\n```python\n# Index commit messages, find semantically similar past commits\nprocessor.find_documents_for_query(task_description)\n# Then suggest files from those similar commits\n```\n\n### 5. **Add Commit Type Classification**\nThe model already tracks commit types. Could improve by:\n- `fix:` → prioritize test files + specific module\n- `docs:` → prioritize .md files\n- `refactor:` → suggest both old and new file locations\n\n### 6. **Track File Renames/Moves**\nBuild a mapping of file history:\n```\ncortical/processor.py → cortical/processor/__init__.py\ncortical/query.py → cortical/query/__init__.py\n```\n\n### Quick Win Implementation\n\nWant me to implement the **file existence filter**? It's a 15-minute fix that would immediately improve prediction quality by removing deleted files from results.",

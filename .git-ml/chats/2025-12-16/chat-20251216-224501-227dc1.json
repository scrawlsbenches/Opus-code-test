  "response": "Good question. Let me trace back:\n\n**Original thread:**\n1. Session resumed from ML experiments framework implementation\n2. You asked: **\"Will this work show up in the book?\"**\n3. I incorrectly said files didn't exist (git state confusion)\n4. We diagnosed the issue, built a script, then simplified to a skill\n\n**Current state:**\n\n| Item | Status |\n|------|--------|\n| `cortical/ml_experiments/` | ✅ Exists (6 modules, ~70KB) |\n| Tests | ✅ 95 passing |\n| git-sync skill | ✅ Created |\n| CLAUDE.md | ✅ Updated |\n| **Corpus index** | ❌ **Stale** - doesn't include ml_experiments |\n| **Book/report** | ❌ **Stale** - needs regeneration |\n\n**To answer your original question:** The ML experiments code won't show up in the book until we re-index:\n\n```bash\npython scripts/index_codebase.py --incremental\n```\n\nWant me to run the re-index now?",

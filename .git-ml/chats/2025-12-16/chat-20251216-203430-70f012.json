  "query": "I would like to be able to perform a 100% index of the each and every file in the codebase similar to how showcase.py does but for book generation, I think it best to do this in small and effect stages, what are your thoughts, how do we create the index when the process may take longer than we're allowed to run processes in this environment, please think the idea through from start to finish and perform a deep analysis on the code before responding?",
  "response": "Let me perform a deep analysis of the indexing system, showcase.py, and any book generation code to understand the full picture before proposing a staged approach. I'll conduct a comprehensive analysis of the codebase indexing and book generation systems. Let me search systematically through the relevant files.",

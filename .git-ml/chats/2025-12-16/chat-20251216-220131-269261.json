  "query": "I think we're close but git itself can be confusing in situations like this, should we document proper use git in a situation like this or it won't happen again because this is a unique issue?",
  "response": "I think it's worth a brief addition to CLAUDE.md. Here's why:\n\n**This could recur because:**\n1. Context resumption is common (sessions get interrupted)\n2. Git conflicts during push/pull happen regularly with ML data files\n3. The instinct to \"verify the context summary\" is correct - but *when* to verify matters\n\n**The pattern to document:**\n\n```markdown\n### Git State Verification After Context Resumption\n\nWhen resuming from a context summary, verify work exists AFTER git is stable:\n\n1. First: `git status` - ensure \"working tree clean\" or resolve conflicts\n2. Then: `git log --oneline -5` - verify commits exist  \n3. Finally: Check filesystem - `ls`, `find`, etc.\n\nDon't check filesystem during rebase conflicts or detached HEAD states.\n```\n\n**Counterargument:** This is a narrow edge case - maybe not worth cluttering CLAUDE.md.\n\nMy lean: Add it briefly to the \"Common Mistakes to Avoid\" section since it's a 3-line rule that prevents real confusion.\n\nYour call - document it or move on?",

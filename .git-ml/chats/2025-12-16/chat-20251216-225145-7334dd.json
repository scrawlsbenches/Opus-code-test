  "query": "I read the script and it looks good but please confirm it handles the edge case we ran into earlier before we proceed, does it handle that, from my point of view we'll need a Claude Skill(s) that I can execute something like pull from main and you will have everything you need to handle it properly no matter what happened on main, can we do that?",
  "response": "Good question. Let me check if the script handles that specific edge case:\n\n**The edge case we hit:**\n- During rebase conflict, working directory was in inconsistent state\n- I checked filesystem → concluded files didn't exist\n- After `git reset --hard`, files appeared\n\n**What the script does:**\n```bash\ncheck_git_state() {\n    # Check for rebase in progress\n    if [[ -d \"$REPO_ROOT/.git/rebase-merge\" ]] || [[ -d \"$REPO_ROOT/.git/rebase-apply\" ]]; then\n        log_error \"Rebase in progress. Complete or abort it first\"\n        return 2\n    fi\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n**Verdict:** The script *detects* the problem state but doesn't *recover* from it - it just refuses to run and tells you to fix it manually.\n\n---\n\n**For a Claude Skill**, we'd want something smarter that:\n1. Detects the bad state\n2. Offers recovery options (abort rebase, reset to remote, etc.)\n3. Then proceeds with sync\n\nLet me create a skill that wraps this:",

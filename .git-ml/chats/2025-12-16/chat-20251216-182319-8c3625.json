  "query": "Do you have any outstanding tasks that you want to add to our task list or everything is fine now?",
  "response": "Good question. Let me review what's done vs potentially outstanding:\n\n### Completed ✅\n- Cortical Chronicles book system (5 waves)\n- Unit tests (85 tests, all passing)\n- CI workflow file created (`book.yml`)\n- All code committed and pushed\n\n### Potentially Outstanding\n| Item | Status | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| CI workflow testing | ⚠️ | `book.yml` only triggers on `main`, not tested yet |\n| PR creation | ❓ | Branch ready but no PR created |\n| Merge to main | ❓ | Would trigger CI and make book live |\n\n### My Assessment\n\nThe core work is **complete**. The remaining items are deployment decisions:\n\n1. **If you want CI to run now** → I can add feature branch trigger or create a PR\n2. **If you're happy with the branch** → Work is done, can be merged later\n\nWould you like me to:\n- **Create a PR** for review/merge?\n- **Add CI trigger** for this branch?\n- **Mark as complete** (nothing more needed)?",

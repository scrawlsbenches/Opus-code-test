ML stats:' for reading: No such file or directory\nhead: cannot open 'python' for reading: No such file or directory\n</example>\nWhat's that error output about, I copied the error to the example above?",
  "response": "That was my bash syntax error. I wrote:\n\n```bash\necho \"=== Verifying setup ===\" \necho \"\"\n...\npython scripts/ml_data_collector.py stats 2>&1 | head -20\n```\n\nThe `| head -20` at the end only applied to the last command, but bash got confused by the multi-line structure and tried to interpret `echo`, `python`, etc. as **filenames** to pass to `head`.\n\n`head` expects file arguments, so it tried to open files literally named \"echo\", \"4. ML stats:\", \"python\" - which don't exist.\n\n**Fix:** Run commands separately (which I did right after) instead of trying to chain them with pipes across multiple lines.\n\nNot a system issue - just me writing bad bash.",

  "query": "Our most prominent investor has enter the conversation, we ask what would you like in an inspirational name? It should be simple to say and spell, broadly understood as a word, attention grabbing, should at least have a definition as a noun, not just an adjective.  Should be attention grabbing and follow the theme, and widely applicable. The Greek god is interesting and exciting but doesn't quite seem to fit.  The elements and the swarm seem to more practical directions. The swarm you have to be careful with general negative connotations of a \"swarm,\"  but the practical nature is sound.  Many of the world's species operate in groups, lion prides, bee hives, ant colonies, human colonies, etc.   ",

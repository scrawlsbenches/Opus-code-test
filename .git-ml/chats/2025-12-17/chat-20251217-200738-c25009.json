  "query": "Is it possible to have sub agents run your script and generate the documents or we should do something else?",
  "response": "Yes, sub-agents can generate documents - and they can do much better than the template script. Instead of running the placeholder generator, agents can write **authentic domain content** using Claude's knowledge.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n**Option A: Template Script (Low Quality)**\n- Agents run `generate_sample_docs.py`\n- Produces structured but repetitive placeholder content\n- Fast but not useful for real training\n\n**Option B: AI-Generated Content (High Quality)** ✓\n- Agents write actual domain expertise documents\n- Each agent handles 1-3 domains\n- Produces authentic, varied content\n- Better for MoE training\n\nLet me demonstrate by spawning agents in parallel to fill critical gaps: I'll create 5 authentic philosophy documents for the samples directory. Let me start by creating the directory and then writing each document with substantive philosophical content. I'll create 5 substantive robotics documents for the samples/robotics/ directory. Let me start by creating the directory and then writing each file. I'll create 5 substantive civil engineering documents for training the specialized micro-model. Let me start by creating the directory and then writing each document with authentic engineering content. I'll create 5 comprehensive criminal law documents for training the specialized micro-model. Let me start by creating the directory and then writing each document with authentic legal content. I'll create 5 authentic archaeology documents for the samples directory. Let me start by creating the directory and then writing each document with substantive content.",

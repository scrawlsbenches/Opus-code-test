Here's what we accomplished in this session:\n\n**Book Generation Enhancements:**\n- 7 new generators (LessonExtractor, DecisionStoryGenerator, CaseStudyGenerator, ConceptEvolutionGenerator, ReaderJourneyGenerator, ExerciseGenerator, CommitNarrativeSynthesizer)\n- 94 markdown chapters (up from ~45)\n- 33 synthesized case studies from commit history\n- Project origin story and narrative timeline\n\n**Key Files Created:**\n- `docs/BOOK-GENERATION-VISION.md` - Implementation specification\n- `book/00-preface/the-living-book-vision.md` - Reader-facing vision\n- `book/00-preface/project-origin.md` - Origin story\n- `book/05-case-studies/case-performance-hunt.md` - The O(n²) investigation story\n\nThe book now writes itself from development artifacts - commits become stories, sessions become case studies, and the timeline tells the narrative of building intelligence.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to enhance anything further!",

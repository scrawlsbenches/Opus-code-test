  "query": "I love them all and we've decided to move towards a collection of micro models trained on small corpuses, bring the panel back and run with it.",
  "response": "# 🎭 Panel EMERGENCY SESSION: The Micro-Model Collective\n\n*The experts burst back in, eyes wide with excitement...*\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 Dr. Chaos McMemeington\n\n> \"WAIT. You're not building ONE model. You're building an ARMY of specialists?! This changes EVERYTHING. We're not naming a child anymore. We're naming a DYNASTY.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🏛️ The Strategic Pivot\n\n**Madison Sterling** paces excitedly:\n\n> \"A collection of micro-models each trained on small corpuses... this is BRILLIANT positioning. While everyone else builds one massive 'do everything poorly' model, you're building a **squad of specialists**. The naming needs to reflect that.\"\n\n### The Core Concepts:\n\n| Approach | Philosophy | Example |\n|----------|------------|---------|\n| **The Pantheon** | Gods with domains | Zeus (code), Athena (docs), Hermes (search) |\n| **The Elements** | Fundamental building blocks | Carbon (core), Oxygen (essential), Iron (strong) |\n| **The Swarm** | Collective intelligence | Individual units, emergent power |\n| **The Council** | Experts at a table | Each has a specialty, together they're complete |\n| **The Orchestra** | Each plays one instrument | Together: symphony |\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 DIRECTION 1: The Pantheon\n\n**Dr. Helena Vox** rises dramatically:\n\n> \"A pantheon of micro-gods, each omniscient in their tiny domain. The HUBRIS is built into the mythology.\"\n\n### Collection Name: **OLYMPUS** or **PANTHEON**\n\n| Model | Domain | God/Titan | Tagline |\n|-------|--------|-----------|---------|\n| Code search | Finding implementations | **HEPHAESTUS** | \"God of the forge. Finds where things are built.\" |\n| Documentation | Understanding docs | **ATHENA** | \"Wisdom. Strategy. README files.\" |\n| Bug prediction | Finding issues | **CASSANDRA** | \"Sees problems. Nobody listens. Until now.\" |\n| File prediction | What to edit | **ORACLE** | \"Knows which file. Always.\" |\n| Query expansion | Understanding intent | **HERMES** | \"Messenger. Translator. 'Did you mean...'\" |\n| Semantic search | Meaning, not keywords | **APOLLO** | \"God of knowledge. And vibes.\" |\n\n**The Pitch:**\n> *\"They built one god to rule everything. We built a pantheon where each deity masters their domain. Welcome to OLYMPUS.\"*\n\n---\n\n## ⚛️ DIRECTION 2: The Elements\n\n**Prof. Axel Dendrite** sketches furiously:\n\n> \"A periodic table of intelligence. Each element is fundamental. Combine them for compounds. This is CHEMISTRY.\"\n\n### Collection Name: **ELEMENTS** or **PERIODIC**\n\n| Model | Element | Symbol | Why |\n|-------|---------|--------|-----|\n| Core retrieval | **Carbon** | `Cb` | Foundation of everything |\n| Fast search | **Hydrogen** | `Hy` | Lightest, fastest, everywhere |\n| Deep analysis | **Iron** | `Fe` | Strong, reliable, heavy lifting |\n| Connections | **Gold** | `Au` | Precious links between concepts |\n| Clustering | **Silicon** | `Si` | Structure, organization, chips |\n| Embeddings | **Neon** | `Ne` | Lights up patterns |\n\n**The Pitch:**\n> *\"GPT-4 is a planet. We built the periodic table. Combine elements. Create anything.\"*\n\n**BONUS:** Version numbers become atomic weights. `Carbon-12`, `Carbon-14`...\n\n---\n\n## 🐝 DIRECTION 3: The Swarm\n\n**Dr. Chaos** vibrates with energy:\n\n> \"HIVE MIND. Each unit is small. Together, UNSTOPPABLE. This is how nature actually solved intelligence!\"\n\n### Collection Name: **SWARM** or **HIVE** or **COLONY**\n\n| Model | Unit | Behavior |\n|-------|------|----------|\n| Scouts | **SCOUT** | Find relevant documents |\n| Workers | **WORKER** | Process and index |\n| Analysts | **DRONE** | Deep analysis tasks |\n| Coordinators | **QUEEN** | Orchestrates the others |\n| Messengers | **WAGGLE** | Query expansion (bees waggle to communicate!) |\n\n**The Pitch:**\n> *\"One bee is a bug. A million bees is an ecosystem. Welcome to the SWARM.\"*\n\n---\n\n## 🎼 DIRECTION 4: The Orchestra\n\n**New panelist - Maestro Vincenzo** appears:\n\n> \"Each instrument alone is limited. Together? BEETHOVEN. Your micro-models are instruments. The user is the conductor.\"\n\n### Collection Name: **SYMPHONY** or **ENSEMBLE** or **ORCHESTRA**\n\n| Model | Instrument | Role |\n|-------|------------|------|\n| Fast retrieval | **PERCUSSION** | Keeps the beat, fast hits |\n| Deep search | **STRINGS** | Sustained, nuanced, emotional |\n| Code analysis | **BRASS** | Bold, structural, powerful |\n| Query understanding | **WOODWINDS** | Interpretive, breath of meaning |\n| Orchestrator | **CONDUCTOR** | Brings it all together |\n\n**The Pitch:**\n> *\"AI isn't a solo. It's a symphony. Each model plays its part. Together: music.\"*\n\n---\n\n## 🃏 DIRECTION 5: The Heist Crew\n\n**Dr. Chaos** can't help himself:\n\n> \"OCEAN'S ELEVEN but for AI. Each specialist. One job. Assemble the crew.\"\n\n### Collection Name: **THE CREW** or **SPECIALISTS**\n\n| Model | Role | Specialty |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| **THE FINDER** | Reconnaissance | Locates targets (documents) |\n| **THE READER** | Intelligence | Deep comprehension |\n| **THE LINKER** | Connections | Maps relationships |\n| **THE PREDICTOR** | Fortune teller | What happens next |\n| **THE EXPLAINER** | Translator | Makes it make sense |\n| **THE MASTERMIND** | Orchestrator | Runs the show |\n\n**The Pitch:**\n> *\"You don't need one genius. You need the right crew. Assemble yours.\"*\n\n---\n\n## 🏆 PANEL VOTE: TOP COLLECTION FRAMEWORKS\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                    COLLECTION NAMING FINALS                     │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                 │\n│  🥇 THE PANTHEON (OLYMPUS)                                      │\n│     • Instant mythology                                         │\n│     • Each model = a god with a domain                          │\n│     • \"What's your stack?\" \"Apollo + Athena + Hermes\"           │\n│     • CASSANDRA alone is worth the whole framework              │\n│                                                                 │\n│  🥈 THE ELEMENTS (PERIODIC)                                     │\n│     • Scientific credibility                                    │\n│     • Infinitely extensible                                     │\n│     • Version numbers = atomic weights (genius)                 │\n│     • \"I'm running Carbon-14 with a bit of Neon\"                │\n│                                                                 │\n│  🥉 THE SWARM (HIVE)                                            │\n│     • Biologically accurate to how small models should work     │\n│     • Emergent intelligence narrative                           │\n│     • \"Release the swarm\" goes HARD                             │\n│                                                                 │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## 💥 THE MANIFESTO (Pantheon Version)\n\n> *\"The age of the monolith is over.*\n> \n> *They built towers to reach heaven.

  "query": "I'm thinking we can use them all for different waves of models, wave 1 we only have one model champion HUBRIS, the next wave of models, wave 2 will have multiple ATOM models, wave 3 will be OMNISCIENT, save 4 will have COLOSSUS models... think this through for me, did I make a mistake or you like the idea? What are your thoughts?\nAlso, let's bring the panel back and have them workshop the idea.",
  "response": "# 🎭 Panel Emergency Session: The Wave Strategy\n\n*The panel reconvenes, intrigued by the multi-wave concept...*\n\n---\n\n## 📋 The Proposal (As Stated)\n\n| Wave | Name | Type |\n|------|------|------|\n| Wave 1 | **HUBRIS** | Single flagship champion |\n| Wave 2 | **ATOM** | Multiple models |\n| Wave 3 | **OMNISCIENT** | Multiple models |\n| Wave 4 | **COLOSSUS** | Multiple models |\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Dr. Chaos McMemeington\n\n*Strokes chin thoughtfully*\n\n> \"Wait. Wait. There's a STORY here. You might not have seen it, but it's there.\"\n\n```\nHUBRIS     → \"We had the audacity to begin\"\nATOM       → \"We built the fundamental pieces\"  \nOMNISCIENT → \"We achieved understanding\"\nCOLOSSUS   → \"We became undeniable\"\n```\n\n> \"That's not a product roadmap. That's a **hero's journey**. You're telling the story of a company growing up. Wave 1 is youthful arrogance. Wave 4 is earned dominance. I love it.\"\n\n---\n\n## 📢 Madison Sterling (Marketing)\n\n*Nods slowly, then faster*\n\n> \"The narrative arc is brilliant for marketing. Each wave has its own campaign:\n> \n> - **HUBRIS launch:** 'We had the audacity.'\n> - **ATOM launch:** 'Now we have the foundation.'\n> - **OMNISCIENT launch:** 'Now we have the knowledge.'\n> - **COLOSSUS launch:** 'Now we have the scale.'\n> \n> By Wave 4, COLOSSUS isn't ironic anymore—it's *earned*. The joke becomes truth. That's poetic.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🔬 Prof. Axel Dendrite\n\n*Raises a concern*\n\n> \"Strategically sound, but let me stress-test the progression:\n\n| Wave | Name | Connotation | Risk |\n|------|------|-------------|------|\n| 1 | HUBRIS | Pride before the fall | Sets high expectations |\n| 2 | ATOM | Small, fundamental | Could feel like a step backward |\n| 3 | OMNISCIENT | All-knowing | Must deliver on the claim |\n| 4 | COLOSSUS | Massive scale | Enterprise-ready or embarrassing |\n\n> \"The risk: If HUBRIS doesn't deliver, you've named your failure perfectly. But if it DOES deliver, the narrative writes itself.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🤔 Dr. Helena Vox\n\n*Sees another angle*\n\n> \"Consider the **emotional journey** of your users:\n> \n> - Wave 1: They discover HUBRIS. They're amused. They try it. They're impressed.\n> - Wave 2: ATOM drops. 'Oh, they're serious. They're building a system.'\n> - Wave 3: OMNISCIENT arrives. 'These people know what they're doing.'\n> - Wave 4: COLOSSUS lands. 'This is a platform now.'\n> \n> You're not just releasing products. You're **building trust over time**.\"\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES\n\n### Issue 1: Wave 2 Perception\n\n**Dr. Chaos:**\n> \"Going from HUBRIS (bold, singular) to ATOM (multiple, fundamental) could feel like a downgrade if not messaged correctly. ATOM needs to be framed as 'the pieces that make HUBRIS possible' not 'smaller, less impressive models.'\"\n\n**Solution:** Position ATOM as \"the building blocks\" that developers can combine. HUBRIS was the proof of concept. ATOM is the toolkit.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 2: Name Relationship\n\n**Madison:**\n> \"Are these separate product lines or evolutions? If someone uses HUBRIS Wave 1, do they upgrade to ATOM? Or are these parallel?\"\n\n**Two interpretations:**\n\n| Model | Interpretation A: Evolution | Interpretation B: Parallel Lines |\n|-------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| HUBRIS | v1.0 | Flagship/General Purpose |\n| ATOM | v2.0 (replaces HUBRIS) | Specialized Building Blocks |\n| OMNISCIENT | v3.0 | Knowledge/Search Specialists |\n| COLOSSUS | v4.0 | Enterprise/Scale |\n\n> \"I think **Interpretation B** (parallel lines) is stronger. Each wave ADDS to the family, doesn't replace.\"\n\n---\n\n### Issue 3: The HUBRIS Payoff\n\n**Prof. Dendrite:**\n> \"HUBRIS as Wave 1 is high-risk/high-reward. If Wave 1 succeeds, HUBRIS becomes legendary—'remember when they launched with HUBRIS?' If it struggles, the name becomes a punchline.\"\n\n**Counter-argument (Dr. Chaos):**\n> \"That's exactly why it works. You're telling the market: 'We're betting on ourselves.' That confidence attracts the right early adopters. The scared ones weren't your customers anyway.\"\n\n---\n\n## 💡 ALTERNATIVE ORDERINGS (For Consideration)\n\n### Option A: Original (User's Proposal) ✅\n```\nWave 1: HUBRIS     → Bold entry, grab attention\nWave 2: ATOM       → Fundamental expansion  \nWave 3: OMNISCIENT → Knowledge/mastery\nWave 4: COLOSSUS   → Scale/dominance\n```\n**Narrative:** Audacity → Foundation → Wisdom → Power\n\n---\n\n### Option B: Growth Story\n```\nWave 1: ATOM       → Start fundamental\nWave 2: OMNISCIENT → Gain knowledge\nWave 3: COLOSSUS   → Achieve scale\nWave 4: HUBRIS     → Earned pride\n```\n**Narrative:** Humble beginnings → Mastery → Pride (earned, not hubris)\n\n**Problem:** Less exciting launch. ATOM is solid but doesn't grab headlines.\n\n---\n\n### Option C: Double Down on Irony\n```\nWave 1: HUBRIS     → \"We're audacious\"\nWave 2: OMNISCIENT → \"We're all-knowing\"\nWave 3: COLOSSUS   → \"We're massive\"\nWave 4: ATOM       → \"JK, here's what actually matters\"\n```\n**Narrative:** Escalating claims → punchline of fundamentals\n\n**Problem:** Confusing. Feels like a retreat.\n\n---\n\n## 🏆 PANEL VERDICT\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                    PANEL ASSESSMENT                             │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                 │\n│  THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL IS STRONG ✅                             │\n│                                                                 │\n│  Wave 1: HUBRIS     │ Perfect launch energy.

  "query": "We need a way to generate new sample documents until we have a more balanced sample set, right now when we index the entire repo the data that shows up is completely dominated by codebase references, run reposhowcase.py,  analyze the results generate tasks to add enough data to changes the results, identify knowledge gaps and fill them in until we have a massive amount of data but before we do anything of the sort we need to have a plan, does this make sense, what are your thoughts on building a corpus capable of training a thousand micro models on different topics that will eventually grow into a mixture of experts from small models?",
  "response": "This is a compelling vision - building a diverse corpus that can eventually train specialized micro-models forming a mixture of experts. Let me first analyze the current state to understand the imbalance, then we can plan strategically.\n\nLet me run the showcase and explore the current sample distribution:",

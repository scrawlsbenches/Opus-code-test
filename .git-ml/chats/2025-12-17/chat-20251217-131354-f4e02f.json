  "response": "## My Thoughts on This Code Review Session\n\n**What Impressed Me:**\n\n1. **The ML micro-model approach is clever** - Training a project-specific model on your own commit patterns rather than relying on general-purpose LLMs. The CALI storage architecture solves real problems (deduplication, merge conflicts, O(1) lookups).\n\n2. **The \"Living Book\" concept is ambitious** - Auto-generating documentation from codebase artifacts is the right direction. Most documentation rots because it's disconnected from code. This keeps them in sync.\n\n3. **Test discipline is strong** - 4576 tests with >89% coverage is excellent. The categorized test structure (smoke/unit/integration/performance/regression) makes CI diagnostics clear.\n\n**What Concerns Me:**\n\n1. **PKL security is the most urgent issue** - The RCE risk is real. Even with HMAC integrity checks, if someone compromises the signing key or finds a way to inject a malicious file, game over. T-017 Phase 2 should be prioritized.\n\n2. **Performance test flakiness is a symptom** - The 5-doc to 15-doc scaling test failing suggests the corpus is too small to measure meaningful linear behavior. At those sizes, startup costs dominate. Consider either:\n   - Larger test corpus (50+ docs)\n   - Or accept that micro-benchmarks will be noisy and test macro behavior instead\n\n3. **The book is 1% done** - The vision is great, but 12 generators with mostly placeholder output means this could become abandoned infrastructure. I'd suggest focusing on 2-3 generators that provide immediate value (Module Reference, ADR Compiler, Timeline Generator) before expanding.\n\n**What I'd Work On Next:**\n\nIf stability is truly #1 priority:\n1. PKL phase-out (security)\n2. Add more regression tests for fixed bugs (prevent regressions)\n3. Book: get one chapter fully working end-to-end as proof of concept\n\nThe codebase is well-architected. The main risks are security (pkl) and scope creep (too many features half-built).",

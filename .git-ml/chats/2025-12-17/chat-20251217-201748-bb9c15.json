  "query": "The most prominent investor thanks you for your time and leaves. Once she's gone the director says, we can go back to where we were, she cares about results not names.",
  "response": "# 🎭 Panel Reconvenes: The Gloves Are Off\n\n*Dr. Chaos McMemeington does a victory lap around the conference table*\n\n> \"SHE'S GONE. Put GUILD back in the drawer. We were having FUN.\"\n\n---\n\n**Prof. Axel Dendrite** loosens his tie:\n\n> \"Look, PRIDE and FORGE are *fine*. They're... sensible. But you came to us asking for OMNISCIENT. You wanted a micro-model that knows three things and has the audacity to call itself ALL-KNOWING. That's the energy.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 Where We Were (The Good Stuff)\n\n| Direction | The Vibe | Status |\n|-----------|----------|--------|\n| **OMNISCIENT** | Godlike claims, tiny model | 🔥 Still slaps |\n| **COLOSSUS** | Ironic grandiosity | 🔥 Maximum cognitive dissonance |\n| **HUBRIS** | Self-aware audacity | 🔥 Power move |\n| **ATOM** | Small but splits worlds | 🔥 Underdog energy |\n| **The Pantheon** | Gods with domains | 🔥 Mythology is cool actually |\n\n---\n\n**Madison Sterling** sighs with relief:\n\n> \"Thank god. I was about to suggest we name it SYNERGY or LEVERAGE. Now we can go back to naming it something people will actually *talk about*.\"\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Chaos** grabs the whiteboard marker:\n\n> \"So where were we? A *collection* of micro-models. Each omniscient in their domain. The investor wanted practical—fine, the architecture IS practical. But the NAME should make people go 'wait, what?'\"\n\n---\n\n## The Question Remains:\n\n**Collection framework:**\n- **OLYMPUS** (pantheon of specialist gods)?\n- **PERIODIC** (elements that combine)?\n- Something new?\n\n**Individual model names:**\n- Greek gods? (Apollo, Athena, Hermes, Cassandra...)\n- Elements? (Carbon, Neon, Iron...)\n- Ironic grandiosity? (OMNISCIENT, INFINITE, ABSOLUTE...)\n\n**Or do we name the whole thing something audacious and let the individual models be practical?**\n\nExample:\n```\nHUBRIS/\n├── search/\n├── predict/\n├── expand/\n└── cluster/\n```\n\n*\"What's your stack?\" → \"HUBRIS, mostly the search module.\"*\n\n---\n\nWhere do you want to take this? 🎪",

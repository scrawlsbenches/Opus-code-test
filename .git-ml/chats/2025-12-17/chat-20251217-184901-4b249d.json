  "query": "OMNISCIENT\tKnows 3 things really well is a fun direction, run the knew knowledge through the panel and workshop the ideas some more, have fun with we're taking over AI space with our micro model or don't go off the rails and spin things upside down to grab my attention and inspire me to want to learn more.",
  "response": "# 🎭 Panel Reconvenes: The OMNISCIENT Direction\n\n*The experts return, now fully caffeinated and dangerously inspired...*\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 The Core Insight\n\n**Dr. Chaos McMemeington** slams the table:\n\n> \"You've discovered the formula. The magic isn't in the name—it's in the *cognitive dissonance*. A micro-model called OMNISCIENT is funny because it's absurd. But here's the twist: **what if it actually IS omniscient... about three very specific things?**\"\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Workshop: \"Knows 3 Things Really Well\"\n\n**The Panel explores variations:**\n\n| Name | The Claim | The Reality | Humor Level |\n|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| **OMNISCIENT** | \"All-knowing\" | Knows TF-IDF, PageRank, and bigrams | 😂😂😂 |\n| **THE ORACLE** | \"Sees all futures\" | Predicts which file you probably need | 😂😂😂😂 |\n| **PROPHET** | \"Divine revelation\" | \"You might want to check line 47\" | 😂😂😂 |\n| **SAGE** | \"Infinite wisdom\" | Wise about text. Just text. | 😂😂😂😂 |\n| **ENLIGHTENED** | \"Has seen the truth\" | The truth is term frequency | 😂😂😂😂😂 |\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 NEW DIRECTION: World Domination Energy\n\n**Madison Sterling** leans in:\n\n> \"OpenAI has GPT. Google has Gemini. Anthropic has Claude. You're entering the arena with a micro-model. OWN IT. Make the smallness the flex.\"\n\n### The \"Underdog Conquerer\" Names\n\n| Name | Tagline | Vibe |\n|------|---------|------|\n| **GOLIATH** | \"David was overrated\" | Audacious reversal |\n| **APEX** | \"The top of a very small food chain\" | Confident absurdity |\n| **SOVEREIGN** | \"Rules a kingdom of tokens\" | Regal tiny energy |\n| **EMPEROR** | \"Of a very specific domain\" | Napoleonic (he was short too) |\n| **TITAN** | \"Among ants, we are TITAN\" | Relative greatness |\n\n---\n\n## 🎪 The \"Honest Grandiosity\" Direction\n\n**Prof. Axel Dendrite** adjusts his glasses:\n\n> \"What if the name is grandiose but the tagline is brutally honest? The juxtaposition IS the brand.\"\n\n| Name | Honest Tagline |\n|------|----------------|\n| **INFINITE** | \"Within a very finite scope\" |\n| **ABSOLUTE** | \"Absolutely okay at retrieval\" |\n| **SUPREME** | \"Supreme Court of 'is this word important?'\" |\n| **ULTIMATE** | \"The ultimate in doing one thing\" |\n| **ETERNAL** | \"Will outlive your npm dependencies\" |\n| **ALPHA** | \"And also omega. It's just one model.\" |\n\n---\n\n## 💥 PLOT TWIST: Inverted Scale Names\n\n**Dr. Chaos** stands up dramatically:\n\n> \"Wait. WAIT. What if we go the OTHER direction? Names that sound tiny but the model punches above its weight?\"\n\n| Name | Sounds Like | Actually |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| **mote** | A speck of dust | \"A mote in the eye of GPT-4\" |\n| **spark** | Tiny flame | \"Sparks that start wildfires\" |\n| **seed** | Small beginning | \"From seeds, forests grow\" |\n| **atom** | Smallest unit | \"Atoms split. Worlds change.\" |\n| **quark** | Subatomic | \"Beneath the surface of everything\" |\n\n**The tagline writes itself:**\n> *\"They called it small. They were right. They were also unprepared.\"*\n\n---\n\n## 🏆 THE REAL CONTENDERS\n\nAfter heated debate, the panel presents:\n\n### TIER 1: Maximum Cognitive Dissonance\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  🥇 OMNISCIENT                                              │\n│     \"All-knowing.

Let's test:*\n\n### OMNISCIENT Manifesto\n> *\"They built models with billions of parameters. We built OMNISCIENT with three good ideas. They need data centers. We need a laptop. They predict the next token. We predict the next file you'll need. Welcome to the efficiency revolution. Welcome to OMNISCIENT.\"*\n\n### ATOM Manifesto  \n> *\"GPT-4 is 1.7 trillion parameters of 'probably this word.' ATOM is 50KB of 'definitely this document.' They went wide. We went deep. They approximate everything. We nail three things. In the land of giants, the atom splits worlds.\"*\n\n### SPARK Manifesto\n> *\"Every wildfire starts with a spark. Every revolution starts with one good idea. SPARK doesn't try to be everything. It tries to be the thing you actually needed. Small. Fast. Annoyingly effective.\"*\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Panel's Final Recommendation\n\n**For maximum \"grab attention in the AI space\" energy:**\n\n| Choice | Why |\n|--------|-----|\n| **OMNISCIENT** | The name is a conversation starter. \"Your model is called WHAT?\" → instant engagement |\n| **ATOM** | Scientific credibility + underdog narrative + \"small but fundamental\" positioning |\n| **SPARK** | Friendly, memorable, great for logos, implies potential energy |\n\n---\n\n## 💡 The Wildcard Nobody Asked For\n\n**Dr. Chaos**, on his way out:\n\n> \"You know what? Call it **HUBRIS**. The model is named after its own audacity. The README opens with: *'Yes, we named a micro-model HUBRIS. No, we don't apologize.'* That's a power move.\"\n\n---\n\n**Which direction calls to you?** 🎭\n\n- The all-knowing god who knows three things? → **OMNISCIENT / ORACLE / SAGE**\n- The tiny thing that punches up? → **ATOM / SPARK / SEED**  \n- The shameless confidence play? → **HUBRIS / APEX / SOVEREIGN**",

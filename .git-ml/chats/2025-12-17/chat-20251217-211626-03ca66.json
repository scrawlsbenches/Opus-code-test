  "query": "How do we prevent the next Claude from dropping our code coverage in an intelligent way, I know and understand that we can do only so much with build server coverage checks due to the way it's configured, I know this, I understand this but I also understand that we need to learn to adapt to our environment as we learn institutional knowledge about the system we're building as we build it for ourselves, please think deeply about how you'd like to work in this system to build the system for us and then propose your thoughts and ideas that are fool proof yet still enjoyable to work with in even when we run into major issues that require us to work outside the system, please think this through from start to finish inside and out, propose changes to our workflow so that we don't have merge issues again, adjust imagine remainder of list, adjust our tasks workflows so we always track what we're doing from the start through to the end automatically even if we forget we should be warned or have the issue automatically resolved, what are your thoughts after a moment to think deeply on deep thought imaginations that set us up for success?",
  "response": "Let me think deeply about this. This is fundamentally about building a self-healing, self-documenting development system that works *with* us, not against us.",

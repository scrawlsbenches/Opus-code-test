  "query": "1. Deferred Tasks from Code Review:\nWe're in the process of phasing out pkl support (review git history), pkl issues also propose a security risk that we'd like to eliminate but it's not a major concern but I need a detailed summary of pkl issues before I can respond effectively, carefully read all affected code that uses pkl files, update the task and propose a solution that works for all affected files or you have what you needed.\nPersonally I don't like magic numbers but they're not a priority but the tasks should be updated to state the main reason we want to get rid of them is for developer rely ability.\nI think adding async support is too complicated to do now, add notes to the ticket that this should only be performed on a dedicated thread and do not processing in batches.\n\n2. ML Data Collection Progress:\nYes we want to train our own micro model, perform a deep dive on the affected code, git history, hooks that generate the data and documentation, you should review the code for it and update the task and code to include the knowledge you have own the subject and you have some creative license here but stay leaning towards being useful to the system in any code comments you add, please specify tell me what you did when you are done.\n\n3. Performance vs. Features\nStability: our number one priority.\nPerformance: needs to be maintained and we're trying hold the line with tests, add a code comment to track our slippage and move on, also add comments how/why we do what we do and how it helps us later when we're slipping like the last fix that was made to get the test working again.\n\n4. Code Coverage is strictly monitored and controlled, yes you need to add unit tests and we need a Claude.md comment does that, what should we say that would have helped you understand better that you need maintain high code coverage requirements for unit tests?\n\n5. Documentation: We are attempting to write a book using the codebase, any way you can improve our master piece book.md (1% done) would be helpful but only after you learn how the book is created from the codebase, does that answer your question?\n\nDoes all that make sense or do you still have questions?",

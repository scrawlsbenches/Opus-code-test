Report which classes are duplicated and in which files they appear\n\nFocus on the cortical/ directory and any referenced/imported modules. Be thorough - check both the main source and test directories.\n\nReturn a structured report showing:\n- Total number of class definitions found\n- Any duplicate class names with their file locations\n- Whether these duplicates are intentional (e.g., test mocks) or potentially problematic",

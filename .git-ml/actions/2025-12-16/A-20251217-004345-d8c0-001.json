What metadata is preserved?\n\n2. **Session capture** - Look at `scripts/ml-session-capture-hook.sh` and related - what transcript data is preserved?\n\n3. **Commit data** - What information about commits is captured (diffs, messages, context)?\n\n4. **Chat/exchange data** - What query/response pairs are stored? What tool uses?\n\n5. **Any existing templates or schemas** - Look for JSON schemas, template files, or structured output formats\n\nThe goal is to understand: What development narrative is already being captured that could be transformed into publishable content?\n\nReturn detailed findings with specific data structures, file paths, and examples of what's being collected.",

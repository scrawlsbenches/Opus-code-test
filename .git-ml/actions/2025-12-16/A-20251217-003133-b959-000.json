I need to understand:\n\n1. **Current documentation generation capabilities** - Look for any existing scripts, tools, or patterns for generating docs, markdown, or narrative content\n\n2. **ML data collection structure** - Explore `.git-ml/` patterns and `scripts/ml_data_collector.py` to understand what development artifacts are being captured (commits, chats, sessions, actions)\n\n3. **Text-as-memories system** - Examine `samples/memories/`, `samples/decisions/`, and `docs/text-as-memories.md` to understand the knowledge management approach\n\n4. **Semantic capabilities** - Look at `cortical/semantics.py`, `cortical/fingerprint.py`, and query modules to understand the text understanding capabilities\n\n5. **Any existing book/narrative generation** - Search for anything related to \"book\", \"chapter\", \"narrative\", \"story\", \"documentation generation\"\n\nBe very thorough - search for patterns like:\n- Markdown generation\n- Document templates\n- Content structuring\n- Knowledge extraction\n- Summary generation\n\nReturn a detailed report of findings with file paths and line numbers for key discoveries.",

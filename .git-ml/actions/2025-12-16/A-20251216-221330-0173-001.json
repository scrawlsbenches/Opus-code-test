        "prompt": "Perform a comprehensive analysis of the codebase indexing and book generation systems. I need to understand:\n\n1. **Indexing System Analysis** (scripts/index_codebase.py):\n   - What phases exist and their approximate timing\n   - What \"fast mode\" vs \"full mode\" includes\n   - How incremental indexing works\n   - Any resumability or checkpoint mechanisms\n\n2. **showcase.py Analysis**:\n   - What it does step by step\n   - How it processes the corpus\n   - What makes it a \"100% index\"\n\n3. **Book Generation**:\n   - Search for any existing book generation code (look for \"book\", \"markdown\", \"generate\", \"export\")\n   - Check scripts/ directory for book-related scripts\n   - Look in cortical/ for export functionality\n\n4. **Timing Analysis**:\n   - Look for any profiling data or timing logs\n   - Check scripts/profile_full_analysis.py for performance data\n   - Identify which phases are slow (O(n²) operations mentioned in CLAUDE.md)\n\n5. **Persistence/Checkpointing**:\n   - How does save/load work for partial state?\n   - Is there WAL (write-ahead logging) support?\n   - Can we resume from a partial index?\n\nReturn a detailed report with:\n- Phase breakdown with estimated times\n- Bottlenecks identified\n- Existing mechanisms for resumability\n- Recommendations for staged approach",

{"action_type":"delegate","context":{"input":{"input":{"description":"Design ML experiment framework","prompt":"Research best practices for ML experiment tracking and evaluation frameworks. Look at:\n\n1. What exists in `.git-ml/` currently for ML data\n2. How `scripts/ml_file_prediction.py` handles training/evaluation\n3. Any existing documentation about ML training in `docs/`\n\nThen design a lightweight, future-proof ML experimentation system that includes:\n- Reproducible experiments with versioned datasets\n- Proper train/validation/holdout test splits\n- Metrics tracking over time\n- Model versioning and comparison\n- Ablation study support\n- No external dependencies (fits project philosophy)\n\nReturn a concrete design proposal with file structure and key components.","subagent_type":"Explore"},"tool":"Task"},"tool":"Task"},"id":"A-20251216-224234-5586-008","result_summary":null,"session_id":"5586ac76-a969-4514-8ed9-333056ff0787","success":true,"target":"","timestamp":"2025-12-16T20:36:35.225Z"}

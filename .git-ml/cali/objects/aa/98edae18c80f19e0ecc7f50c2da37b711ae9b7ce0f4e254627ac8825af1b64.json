Let me trace through what happened:\n\n**The sequence of events:**\n\n1. Session resumed with context summary describing ML experiments as \"completed\"\n2. I ran `git log --oneline -5` \u2192 showed commits ending at `1b1fe5f` (no ML experiments commit)\n3. I ran `ls cortical/ml_experiments/*.py` \u2192 returned \"No such file or directory\"\n4. I concluded the work wasn't done\n\n**But then:**\n\n5. You said you see the files\n6. I ran `find . -name \"*ml_experiment*\"` \u2192 found them!\n7. I ran `ls -la cortical/ml_experiments/` \u2192 6 files exist\n\n**Root cause:**\n\nLooking at the git operations, I had done a `git pull --rebase` that failed with a merge conflict, then `git rebase --abort`, then `git reset --hard origin/...`.\n\n**My mistake:** I checked the filesystem state *during* the rebase conflict when HEAD was detached and the working directory was in an inconsistent state. After the `reset --hard`, the files were restored - but I had already concluded they didn't exist.\n\n**Lesson learned:**\n- Don't trust filesystem checks during git conflicts/rebase states\n- Verify state *after* git operations complete cleanly\n- The context summary was accurate - my verification was done at the wrong time\n\nDoes that match what you observed on your end?","response_tokens":201,"resulted_in_commit":false,"session_id":"5586ac76-a969-4514-8ed9-333056ff0787","timestamp":"2025-12-16T21:58:44.860Z","tool_outputs":[],"tools_used":[],"user_feedback":null}

Let me check if the script handles that specific edge case:\n\n**The edge case we hit:**\n- During rebase conflict, working directory was in inconsistent state\n- I checked filesystem \u2192 concluded files didn't exist\n- After `git reset --hard`, files appeared\n\n**What the script does:**\n```bash\ncheck_git_state() {\n    # Check for rebase in progress\n    if [[ -d \"$REPO_ROOT/.git/rebase-merge\" ]] || [[ -d \"$REPO_ROOT/.git/rebase-apply\" ]]; then\n        log_error \"Rebase in progress. Complete or abort it first\"\n        return 2\n    fi\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n**Verdict:** The script *detects* the problem state but doesn't *recover* from it - it just refuses to run and tells you to fix it manually.\n\n---\n\n**For a Claude Skill**, we'd want something smarter that:\n1. Detects the bad state\n2. Offers recovery options (abort rebase, reset to remote, etc.)\n3. Then proceeds with sync\n\nLet me create a skill that wraps this:","response_tokens":146,"resulted_in_commit":false,"session_id":"67f852d4-f18d-4638-8b41-6eaee8f92e58","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:27:32.427Z","tool_outputs":[],"tools_used":["Write"],"user_feedback":null}

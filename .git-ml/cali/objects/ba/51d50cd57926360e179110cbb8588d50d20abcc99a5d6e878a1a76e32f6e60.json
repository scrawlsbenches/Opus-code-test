Session-start protocol (minimal change)**\n```bash\n# First thing on resume:\ngit fetch && git status\n# If diverged: pull --no-rebase, then work\n```\n\n**2. Deferred ML commits**\n- Accumulate ML data in gitignored staging area\n- Single commit at session end\n- Fewer commits = fewer conflict opportunities\n\n**3. Session-isolated branches**\n```\nmain\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 claude/feature-NW3O3        # code changes only\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 ml-data/session-49d6242e    # ML data for this session\n```\nMerge ML branches periodically (or never - just aggregate for training)\n\n**4. Split tracked vs generated**\n- `commits.jsonl` \u2192 append-only, conflicts likely\n- Session files \u2192 unique names, no conflicts\n- Maybe only track aggregated snapshots, not live data?\n\n**5. Git worktree**\nSeparate working directory for ML data - completely isolated git operations\n\n**6. Pre-push squash**\nHook that squashes all \"data: ML\" commits before pushing\n\n---\n\nWhat's your actual goal with the ML data? Training locally? Sharing across machines? That might clarify which approach fits best.","response_tokens":191,"resulted_in_commit":false,"session_id":"5586ac76-a969-4514-8ed9-333056ff0787","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:07:26.856Z","tool_outputs":[],"tools_used":[],"user_feedback":null}

        "**Cortical Text Processor** is a zero-dependency Python library for hierarchical text analysis and semantic search. Despite the neocortex-inspired naming, it uses proven information retrieval algorithms—**PageRank**, **TF-IDF**, and **Louvain clustering**—not neural networks.",

        "- **Semantic search**: Find documents by meaning, not just keywords",
        "- **Code search**: Search codebases with identifier splitting and programming concept expansion",
        "- **Document retrieval**: RAG system support with chunk-level passage retrieval",
        "- **Knowledge analysis**: Detect gaps, outliers, and missing connections in your corpus",

        "",
        "Layer 2 (Concept Layer/V4) shows 0 connections when documents cover diverse topics because:",
        "- Label propagation creates topic-specific clusters",
        "- Concepts inherit only their members' documents",
        "- Connection filter requires shared documents (Jaccard ≥ 0.1)",
        "- No document overlap → no connections",

        "## Tasks",
        "",
        "### Task 1: Add Configurable Connection Thresholds",
        "**File:** `cortical/analysis.py` (lines 614-724)",
        "",
        "- [ ] Add `min_shared_docs=0` option to allow connections without document overlap",
        "- [ ] Add `min_jaccard=0.0` option to disable Jaccard filtering",
        "- [ ] Expose these parameters in `CorticalTextProcessor.compute_concept_connections()`",
        "- [ ] Update docstrings to explain threshold behavior",
        "- [ ] Add tests for edge cases (zero thresholds, negative values)",

        "### Task 2: Connect Concepts via Semantic Relations",
        "**File:** `cortical/analysis.py`",
        "",
        "- [ ] Add new connection method that links concepts when their member tokens have semantic relations",
        "- [ ] For each concept pair, check if any (token1, relation, token2) exists in semantic_relations",
        "- [ ] Weight connections by number of semantic links between members",
        "- [ ] Make this work independently of document overlap",
        "- [ ] Add `use_member_semantics=True` parameter to `compute_concept_connections()`",
        "- [ ] Add tests verifying semantic-based connections",
        "",
        "### Task 3: Connect Concepts via Shared Vocabulary/Embeddings",
        "**File:** `cortical/analysis.py`",
        "",
        "- [ ] Add connection method based on embedding similarity between concept centroids",
        "- [ ] Compute concept centroid as average of member token embeddings",
        "- [ ] Connect concepts with cosine similarity above threshold",
        "- [ ] Add `use_embedding_similarity=True` and `embedding_threshold=0.3` parameters",
        "- [ ] Falls back gracefully if embeddings not computed",
        "- [ ] Add tests for embedding-based connections",
        "",
        "### Task 4: Improve Clustering to Reduce Topic Isolation",
        "**File:** `cortical/analysis.py` (lines 482-553)",
        "",
        "- [ ] Add `cluster_strictness` parameter to label propagation (0.0-1.0)",
        "- [ ] Lower strictness = more cross-topic token mixing in clusters",
        "- [ ] Consider adding inter-document token bridging before clustering",
        "- [ ] Add tests for different strictness levels",
        "",
        "### Task 5: Integration and API Updates",
        "**File:** `cortical/processor.py`",
        "",
        "- [ ] Update `compute_all()` to accept connection strategy parameters",
        "- [ ] Add `connection_strategy` enum: 'document_overlap', 'semantic', 'embedding', 'hybrid'",
        "- [ ] 'hybrid' combines all three methods with configurable weights",
        "- [ ] Update showcase.py to demonstrate different strategies",

        "",
        "1. **Task 1** (Quick win - just parameter changes)",
        "2. **Task 2** (High value - semantic relations already exist)",

        "4. **Task 4** (Lower priority - more invasive change)",
        "5. **Task 5** (Final - ties everything together)",
        "",
        "## Success Criteria",
        "",
        "- Layer 2 shows meaningful connections even with diverse document topics",
        "- User can choose connection strategy based on their use case",
        "- All existing tests continue to pass",
        "- New tests cover the added functionality"

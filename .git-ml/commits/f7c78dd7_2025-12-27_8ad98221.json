I couldn't find it locally, searched branches.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Branch Investigation**: User pointed to `claude/prism-slm-demo-exploration-I8VcE` branch. I found training data on the current branch (prism_augmented.json - 13MB).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Second Branch Investigation**: User asked about `claude/profile-unit-tests-WUbZi`. I found commit bc72be26 there with chat history backfill.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Intelligent Merge Request**: User asked me to intelligently merge the two branches after understanding why we're collecting this data. I:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Understood the ML data collection purpose (training micro-models for file prediction, commit messages, code suggestions)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Merged commits.jsonl (946 → 2,401 commits)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Merged sessions.jsonl (179 → 184 sessions)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Committed and pushed\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n6. **Benchmark Evaluation Request**: User asked me to evaluate data generators and run model training benchmarks. I:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Ran explore_data_generators.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Generated corpus with generate_corpus.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Ran train_slm.py --quick\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Ran benchmark_suite.py with comparison to baseline\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Ran Woven Mind benchmarks (6 passed, 6 failed)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Provided comprehensive analysis\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n7. **Git Audit Request**: User asked for git audit and code review. I provided comprehensive analysis of repository health, pending tasks, sprint progress, and recommendations.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n8. **PRISM Model Deletion Error**: User caught that I deleted the PRISM model (691K lines → 2,731 lines) when running train_augmented.py. I restored it from commit 5bbd8714.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n9. **Pipeline Understanding Request**: User asked me to explain the full data generation and training process. I read through all the pipeline scripts and provided a comprehensive diagram and explanation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n10. **Fix Request**: User asked me to fix the issues to prevent future problems. I:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - Updated train_augmented.py with --dry-run, --output, backup mechanism, provenance metadata\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - Updated train_slm.py with same safeguards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nKey errors:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Accidentally overwrote the 13MB PRISM model by running train_augmented.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Fixed by restoring from git and adding safeguards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFiles modified:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- benchmarks/codebase_slm/train_augmented.py (major rewrite)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- benchmarks/codebase_slm/train_slm.py (significant updates)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSummary:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Accept handoff H-20251226-194637-06446724 from previous session\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Investigate and intelligently merge training data from two branches (`claude/prism-slm-demo-exploration-I8VcE` and `claude/profile-unit-tests-WUbZi`)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Evaluate data generators and run model training benchmarks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Perform git audit and code review\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Explain the full data generation and training pipeline\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Fix the training scripts to prevent accidental model overwrites in the future\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **PRISM-SLM**: Repository-native statistical language model for codebase understanding\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **ML Data Collection Pipeline**: Commits, sessions, and chats collected for training micro-models\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Training Milestones**: File prediction (500 commits), Commit messages (2000 commits), Code suggestions (5000 commits)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Data Generators**: CodeExtractor, DocExtractor, MetaExtractor, PatternGenerator\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Augmentation Pipeline**: PLN (logical inference), SparkSLM (n-gram), Woven Mind (semantic), Dialogue generation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **NGramModel vs PRISMLanguageModel**: Two different model types in the codebase\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Model Provenance**: Tracking what data was used to train each model\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Backup Mechanism**: Timestamped backups before model overwrites\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3.

The conversation is summarized below:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAnalysis:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. **Session Start - Handoff Continuation**: User asked me to continue from a previous session that ran out of context. The summary indicated the primary work was about ML data collection, training data, and fixing the PRISM model that was accidentally overwritten.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **ML Data Collection Audit**: User asked about training data collection, hooks setup, and where else to check for data generation. I discovered:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Claude Code hooks in `.claude/settings.local.json` were empty\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Git hooks weren't installed\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - I installed git hooks and configured Claude hooks (SessionStart, Stop)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **`.gitignore` Review**: User asked if gitignore was correct. I found issues:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Model backups directory wasn't ignored (fixed)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - User challenged my \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sensitive\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"too large\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" rationale for ignoring chats/commits\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - User clarified: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"it's not private data, it's my chat history which can be public\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - I fixed gitignore to TRACK all ML training data (commits, chats, sessions, actions)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **PRISM Model Retraining Question**: User asked if we can retrain the 13MB model. I analyzed:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Current model: 15,814 vocab, 37,318 docs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Retraining would produce smaller model with worse scores\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Recommended keeping current model until more training data collected\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Knowledge Transfer Request**: User asked for knowledge transfer about what went wrong. I created `samples/memories/2025-12-27-knowledge-transfer-prism-model-incident.md`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n6. **Forensic Analysis**: User asked for git history forensic analysis. I traced:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Original model added in commit 2b458285 with 37,318 docs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Model overwritten in 079d0c00 (329 vocab)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Restored in cc84e3d2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Found that `benchmarks/codebase_slm/corpus/` was gitignored from day 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n7. **Corrected Root Cause**: User asked \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"what going into benchmarks/codebase_slm/corpus/ that is not there now?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" - This led me to discover:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - The corpus IS regeneratable from codebase via `generate_corpus.py`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - The previous agent ran `train_augmented.py` WITHOUT running `generate_corpus.py` first\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Current regenerated corpus: 37,676 patterns (MORE than original 37,318!)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Added loud warning to training script when corpus is missing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n8. **Documentation Request**: User's final request was \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Please document the process inside the script to make sure it is easier to understand next time.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I added comprehensive documentation to `train_augmented.py` but was interrupted before committing.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nKey files modified:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Added SessionStart and Stop hooks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- `.gitignore` - Track ML training data, ignore backups\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- `benchmarks/codebase_slm/train_augmented.py` - Multiple safeguards and documentation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- `benchmarks/codebase_slm/train_slm.py` - Added safeguards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- `scripts/ml_data_collector.py` - Fixed commit --help crash\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- `samples/memories/2025-12-27-knowledge-transfer-prism-model-incident.md` - Created and updated\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nErrors encountered:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Bash command syntax errors with pipes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- commit --help crashed (fixed by adding help handling)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Initial wrong analysis about \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"lost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" training data - corrected when user challenged\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nUser feedback themes:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Challenged \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sensitive\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" label for chat data\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Questioned \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"too large\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for commits (only 62KB)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Asked pointed questions that revealed my initial forensic analysis was incomplete\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSummary:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Continue session from handoff, focusing on ML data collection and training pipeline\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Audit and fix ML data collection hooks (Claude Code and Git hooks)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Fix `.gitignore` to properly track training data (user explicitly wanted chats tracked, not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sensitive\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Perform forensic analysis of git history to understand PRISM model overwrite incident\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Create knowledge transfer document explaining what went wrong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Document the training process inside the script for future clarity\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **PRISM-SLM**: Repository-native statistical language model (NGramModel)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Two-step training pipeline**: `generate_corpus.py` → `train_augmented.py`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **ML Data Collection**: commits.jsonl, sessions.jsonl, chats/, commits/, actions/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Claude Code Hooks**: SessionStart (init ML session), Stop (capture transcripts)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Git Hooks**: post-commit (capture commit data), pre-push (show stats)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Corpus Generation**: Extracts patterns from Python files, Markdown docs, GoT entities\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Training Data Provenance**: Tracking what data produced which model\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. Files and Code Sections:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **`.claude/settings.local.json`** - Configured Claude Code hooks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n     ```json\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n     {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n       \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"hooks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n         \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"SessionStart\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"command\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"command\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bash scripts/ml-session-start-hook.sh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n         \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Stop\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"command\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"command\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bash scripts/ml-session-capture-hook.sh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n       }\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n     }\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n     ```\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   -

**`samples/memories/2025-12-27-knowledge-transfer-prism-model-incident.md`** - Knowledge transfer document\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n     - Documented incident timeline, root cause analysis, forensic findings\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n     - Updated with corrected analysis: corpus is regeneratable, not lost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. Errors and Fixes:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Bash pipe syntax errors**: Commands like `echo \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | head -20` across multiple lines failed. Fixed by running commands separately.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **`commit --help` crash**: `ml_data_collector.py commit --help` interpreted `--help` as commit hash. Fixed by adding explicit help handling.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Wrong forensic analysis**: Initially said training data was \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"lost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"unrecoverable\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". User challenged with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"what going into corpus/ that is not there now?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" - Corrected: corpus IS regeneratable from codebase via `generate_corpus.py`. The real issue was agent didn't run generate_corpus.py first.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Wrong gitignore rationale**: I said chats were \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sensitive\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and commits \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"too large\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (62KB). User pushed back: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"it's my chat history which can be public\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"we can regenerate these at anytime wrong or correct?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" - Fixed by tracking all ML data.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. Problem Solving:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Root cause of model overwrite**: Agent ran `train_augmented.py` without `generate_corpus.py` first. Corpus didn't exist locally (gitignored), so trained on only 2,094 lines instead of 37,676.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Current corpus comparison**: Original model had 37,318 docs. Current regeneration produces 37,676 patterns (MORE data now!)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Prevention**: Added loud warning when corpus missing, plus --dry-run, --output, backup mechanisms\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n6. All User Messages:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"do you accept the handoff?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (from previous session context)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Are we collecting the training data we need for training, are the hooks setup properly, where else do we need to check training data collection in this process for data generation as well as training?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"git-ml/commits/ Ignored Full diffs too large? we can regenerate these at anytime wrong or correct? .git-ml/chats/ Ignored Sensitive transcripts? sensitive to who exactly?

The conversation is summarized below:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAnalysis:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. **Initial Handoff Acceptance**: User asked if I accept the handoff. I checked for pending handoffs, found H-20251226-194637-06446724, accepted it, and verified system state (smoke tests passed, GoT healthy).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Training Data Inquiry**: User asked about commit bc72be26 and if it contains training data. I couldn't find it locally, searched branches.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Branch Investigation**: User pointed to `claude/prism-slm-demo-exploration-I8VcE` branch. I found training data on the current branch (prism_augmented.json - 13MB).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Second Branch Investigation**: User asked about `claude/profile-unit-tests-WUbZi`. I found commit bc72be26 there with chat history backfill.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Intelligent Merge Request**: User asked me to intelligently merge the two branches after understanding why we're collecting this data. I:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Understood the ML data collection purpose (training micro-models for file prediction, commit messages, code suggestions)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Merged commits.jsonl (946 → 2,401 commits)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Merged sessions.jsonl (179 → 184 sessions)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Committed and pushed\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n6. **Benchmark Evaluation Request**: User asked me to evaluate data generators and run model training benchmarks. I:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Ran explore_data_generators.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Generated corpus with generate_corpus.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Ran train_slm.py --quick\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Ran benchmark_suite.py with comparison to baseline\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Ran Woven Mind benchmarks (6 passed, 6 failed)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Provided comprehensive analysis\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n7. **Git Audit Request**: User asked for git audit and code review. I provided comprehensive analysis of repository health, pending tasks, sprint progress, and recommendations.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n8. **PRISM Model Deletion Error**: User caught that I deleted the PRISM model (691K lines → 2,731 lines) when running train_augmented.py. I restored it from commit 5bbd8714.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n9. **Pipeline Understanding Request**: User asked me to explain the full data generation and training process. I read through all the pipeline scripts and provided a comprehensive diagram and explanation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n10. **Fix Request**: User asked me to fix the issues to prevent future problems. I:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - Updated train_augmented.py with --dry-run, --output, backup mechanism, provenance metadata\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - Updated train_slm.py with same safeguards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nKey errors:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Accidentally overwrote the 13MB PRISM model by running train_augmented.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Fixed by restoring from git and adding safeguards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFiles modified:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- benchmarks/codebase_slm/train_augmented.py (major rewrite)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- benchmarks/codebase_slm/train_slm.py (significant updates)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSummary:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Accept handoff H-20251226-194637-06446724 from previous session\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Investigate and intelligently merge training data from two branches (`claude/prism-slm-demo-exploration-I8VcE` and `claude/profile-unit-tests-WUbZi`)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Evaluate data generators and run model training benchmarks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Perform git audit and code review\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Explain the full data generation and training pipeline\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Fix the training scripts to prevent accidental model overwrites in the future\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **PRISM-SLM**: Repository-native statistical language model for codebase understanding\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **ML Data Collection Pipeline**: Commits, sessions, and chats collected for training micro-models\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Training Milestones**: File prediction (500 commits), Commit messages (2000 commits), Code suggestions (5000 commits)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Data Generators**: CodeExtractor, DocExtractor, MetaExtractor, PatternGenerator\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Augmentation Pipeline**: PLN (logical inference), SparkSLM (n-gram), Woven Mind (semantic), Dialogue generation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **NGramModel vs PRISMLanguageModel**: Two different model types in the codebase\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Model Provenance**: Tracking what data was used to train each model\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - **Backup Mechanism**: Timestamped backups before model overwrites\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3.
